"""Framework-neutral auth core: Argon2id password hashing (`PasswordService`),
PyJWT-based HS256 access/refresh tokens (`TokenService`), and the
`AuthService` orchestrator implementing register/login/refresh/logout --
including the refresh-token ROTATION-WITH-REUSE-DETECTION state machine,
the security-critical part of this module. Canon:
references/security/secure-baseline.md ("Hash passwords with a strong
adaptive algorithm... Tokens (JWT/session) validated fully -- signature,
expiry, audience/issuer -- with sensible expiry and secure rotation/
logout. Prefer short-lived access tokens with refresh over long-lived
static tokens").

Drop-in: copy this file into app/core/security/auth/_core.py (keep it
alongside fastapi.py/django.py from the same directory, once a later
stage adds them -- this component ships the framework-neutral core only;
wiring it into a FastAPI or Django backend block is separate work). Stdlib
+ PyJWT + argon2-cffi only -- **no FastAPI, Django, or SQLAlchemy import
anywhere in this file.** `UserStore` and `RefreshTokenStore` below are
`Protocol`s a framework adapter implements against its own ORM/session;
this module never touches a database, a request object, or a settings
object directly -- every secret/TTL/store it needs is passed in by the
caller.

**This file raises its OWN exception hierarchy** (`AuthError` and its
subclasses below) rather than importing
`templates/components/backend/error-envelope/errors.py`'s `AppError`/
`ErrorCode` -- that keeps this module importable with zero framework/
app-layer dependencies. Each exception's docstring names the `ErrorCode`
member (from that LOCKED, closed enum -- this module does NOT extend it)
a framework adapter's exception handler is expected to map it onto.

**The refresh-rotation state machine (`AuthService.refresh`) is the
security-critical core of this module** -- read its docstring and
`tests/test_core.py`'s reuse-detection tests before touching it. Summary:
every refresh token is single-use; presenting an already-used one means
the client's token was stolen and used by someone else first (or the
legitimate client raced itself) -- either way, the entire token FAMILY
(every token descended from one login) is revoked immediately, forcing a
fresh login. The persisted `RefreshRecord` (looked up by SHA-256 hash of
the raw token), never the JWT's own claims, is the sole source of truth
for whether a refresh token is still valid -- a validly-signed,
unexpired JWT whose row has been marked used/revoked/deleted is still
rejected, because trust lives in the store, not in what the client is
merely able to present.

    equivalent) so every test in `tests/` can advance time deterministically
    (expiry, rotation) without sleeping in a test or monkeypatching a
    module-global clock. `now()` MUST return a timezone-aware `datetime` in
    UTC -- a naive datetime would make the `exp`/`iat` timestamp math
    ambiguous about which timezone it's relative to.

    Access token claims: `sub` (principal id, as a string), `type`
    (literal `"access"`), `iat`, `exp`, `iss`, `jti` (a fresh `uuid4` hex
    per token), `roles` (list of role strings).

    Refresh token claims: `sub`, `type` (literal `"refresh"`), `iat`,
    `exp`, `iss`, `jti`, `fid` (the token's FAMILY id -- shared by every
    refresh token descended from one login, via rotation; see
    `AuthService.refresh`).

    Decoding verifies the signature (HS256 only -- `algorithms=["HS256"]`
    is passed explicitly on every decode call, never inferred from the
    token's own header, which would let a malicious token dictate its own
    verification algorithm), issuer, and the presence of every claim
    above via `options={"require": [...]}}`. **Expiry is checked
    manually against the injected `now()`, not PyJWT's own built-in
    wall-clock check** (`verify_exp`/`verify_iat` are explicitly turned
    OFF in the `options` passed to `jwt.decode`) -- PyJWT's own expiry
    validation always compares against the real system clock
    (`datetime.now(tz=timezone.utc)`) with no way to inject a substitute,

    past the TTL, assert `InvalidToken`" tests either flaky (racing the
    real clock) or entirely disconnected from the `now` this class was
    actually constructed with. Checking it manually, against the exact
    same `now` every other part of this class uses, is what makes expiry
    fully deterministic under test. Then additionally asserts the decoded
    `type` claim matches what the caller asked for
    (`decode_access` requires `type == "access"`, `decode_refresh`
    requires `type == "refresh"`). An access token presented where a
    refresh token is expected (or vice versa) is REJECTED at this `type`
    check, not silently accepted just because it happens to be a
    validly-signed JWT from the same issuer -- the two token kinds are
    security-distinct (a refresh token grants a NEW token pair; an access
    token does not) and must never be interchangeable.

    Every failure mode -- bad signature, expired, wrong issuer, malformed/
    missing claims, wrong `type` -- raises `InvalidToken`, never a raw

    infrastructure code, not part of this framework-neutral core.

    **Implementations MUST NOT let delivery latency or delivery failure

    delivery error internally rather than propagating it. Two callers in

    `AccountService.request_password_reset`'s known-email branch awaits
    `send()` and then returns `None` exactly like the unknown-email
    branch -- if `send()` could raise or could block for a real SMTP
    round-trip, a delivery failure or a slow relay would turn into either
    a different HTTP outcome or a different response latency for a known

    failed verification-email `send()` during registration (`AccountService.
    request_email_verification`, called from a framework adapter's
    register handler) must never be able to brick a just-created account.
    `ConsoleEmailSender` (fast, synchronous, and it only ever logs -- it
    cannot itself fail in a way worth propagating) satisfies this
    trivially; a real SMTP-backed sender must actively deliver on a
    background task/thread and catch its own errors -- see this

           account, so a correct guess against a locked account costs
           the identical time and yields the identical outcome as a

        Implements, in this exact order:

        1. `TokenService.decode_refresh` -- structural validation only
           (signature, expiry, issuer, `type == "refresh"`). Invalid on
           any of those grounds -> `InvalidToken`. The decoded claims are
           deliberately NOT otherwise trusted below -- the persisted
           `RefreshRecord` (looked up next, by hash) is the sole source of
           truth for whether this token is still usable; a validly-signed
           JWT whose row says otherwise still loses.
        2. Hash the raw token (`hash_token`) and look it up
           (`RefreshTokenStore.get_by_hash`). **No row** means a validly-
           signed token that this store has never heard of (or no longer
           does) -- forged, or a genuine token from a family/row that's
           been deleted. This does NOT trust the token's own claims to
           revoke anything (there is nothing on file to revoke) --
           just `InvalidToken`.
        3. **`row.revoked`** -> `InvalidToken`. The token's family was
           already killed (by a prior reuse-detection event or a
           `logout()`).
        4. **`row.used_at is not None`** -> **REUSE DETECTED.** This
           exact token was already rotated once before; a second
           presentation of it now can only mean the token was
           compromised (or, less commonly, a client-side race). Calls
           `RefreshTokenStore.revoke_family(row.family_id)` -- revoking
           EVERY row in the family, including whichever token is
           currently the "live" tip of the rotation chain -- then raises
           `TokenReused`. This is deliberately more aggressive than just
           rejecting the reused token: an attacker holding a stolen
           refresh token and a legitimate client both descend from the
           same family, so killing only the reused token would leave
           whichever side currently holds the live rotated token still
           logged in -- which could be the attacker.
        5. **`row.expires_at <= now()`** -> `InvalidToken`. An unused,
           non-revoked row past its own TTL.
        6. **Otherwise, valid:** `RefreshTokenStore.mark_used(row.
           token_hash, now())` (so this exact row can never validate
           again -- see step 4 for why that matters), then mint a NEW
           access token and a NEW refresh token in the SAME family
           (`family_id=row.family_id` -- rotation extends a family, it
           does not start a new one), persist the new refresh token's
           `RefreshRecord`, and return the new `TokenPair`. The just-used
           row is retained with `used_at` set, NOT deleted.

        `TokenReused` and `InvalidToken` both map to `ErrorCode.
        UNAUTHENTICATED` (401) -- see `TokenReused`'s own docstring for

    FRAGMENT (`#token=...`), never a query string, DELIBERATELY: a

    client-side-only part of the URL) and is typically excluded from
    `Referer` headers and most access/proxy logs, whereas a query string

    single-use, highly sensitive token (equivalent to a bearer credential
    until consumed) out of server logs, proxy logs, and any third-party
    `Referer` a page on that route might send a request to, purely via
    where in the URL it's placed. The SPA's own client-side routing reads
    `window.location.hash` and POSTs the token to the backend directly --
    this module has no opinion on how; that is app-layer wiring.

    `verify_ttl`/`reset_ttl` default to 24 hours / 1 hour respectively --
    a verification link tolerates sitting unread in an inbox far longer
    than a password-reset link should remain valid, since an unconsumed

        "no account with that email" message is such a natural thing to
        want to show).

        **Found:** issues a `"reset"` single-use token (ttl `reset_ttl`,
        ~1h by default) and emails a reset link containing it (fragment-
        encoded). The `EmailSender.send()` call is wrapped in a bare
        `try/except Exception`: a delivery failure (the sender raising)
        is caught, an `auth.password.reset_email_failed` audit event is
        emitted (when `events` is wired) instead of `reset_requested`,
        and this method still returns `None` -- it NEVER re-raises. This
        is the core of the anti-enumeration defense, not an incidental
        robustness nicety: if a known email's `send()` failure were
        allowed to propagate (and a framework adapter's route left it
        uncaught, as this component expects -- see `EmailSender`'s own
        docstring), a known email would 500 while an unknown one still
        202s, which IS an account-enumeration oracle (an SMTP outage, a
        bounced/invalid mailbox, a rate-limited relay -- any of these
        would out a registered address). The token is still issued and
        persisted before `send()` is attempted, so a failed delivery
        never silently discards work the caller might expect to retry.

        **Not found:** computes a throwaway token
        (`secrets.token_urlsafe(32)`) and hashes it (`hash_token`) --
        discarding both immediately, never persisting or sending
        anything -- so this path spends comparable CPU/allocation cost
        to the found path's `SingleUseTokenService.issue` (itself a
        `secrets.token_urlsafe` + `hash_token`), keeping the two paths
        close in timing even though this method's overall cost is
        dominated by whatever the caller's own response latency looks
        like (unlike `AuthService.login`, there's no slow Argon2 op
        gating either path here, so an exact single-Argon2-op timing
        match isn't the goal -- the CPU-comparable throwaway op is a
        best-effort match, not a formal guarantee). The found path's own
        `send()` no longer costs a real SMTP round-trip either, by
        contract (see `EmailSender`'s docstring: a compliant sender
        delivers out-of-band and returns promptly) -- so this was never
        a race against real network latency to begin with, on either
        path.

        Either way, emits `auth.password.reset_requested` on a
        successful (or not-attempted, for the not-found path) send, with
        `actor=user.id` (found) or `actor="user:unknown"` (not found) --
        **never the submitted email itself**, in either branch, so the
        audit trail cannot be grepped for "which email addresses did
        someone try resetting" even by someone with access to it."""

        persisted or passed to `UserStore`, matching `AuthService.
        register`'s own posture), overwrites the user's stored hash
        (`UserStore.set_password_hash`), then revokes EVERY refresh-token
        family the user has (`RefreshTokenStore.revoke_all_for_user`) --
        killing every existing logged-in session everywhere, since
        whatever was true about the account's security under the OLD
        password can no longer be assumed once it's been reset. If a
        `lockout` policy was wired, also clears any failed-login lockout on
        the account (see `__init__`'s `lockout` note) so the reset restores
        access immediately.

        **Also marks the account's email verified** (`UserStore.
        mark_email_verified(user_id, self._now())`), regardless of whether
        it already was. Rationale: successfully consuming a `"reset"`
        single-use token proves control of the account's email -- the
        token was only ever delivered to that inbox (see `request_
        password_reset`'s own docstring) -- which is exactly the same
        proof-of-inbox-control `verify_email` establishes via a `"verify"`
        token; completing a reset therefore satisfies email verification
        too. This is deliberately the RECOVERY PATH for an account whose
        original verification email never arrived: `register`'s
        post-registration `request_email_verification` call can fail to
        deliver (an SMTP outage, a bounced address at signup time) without
        the caller being told -- see this component's FastAPI backend's
        `register` handler, which never lets that failure turn a 201 into
        a 500 -- so without this, such an account would be permanently
        stuck behind `AuthService.login`'s `require_verification` gate
        with no way back in. Ordered AFTER session revocation and the
        lockout clear above, so a reset invalidates old credentials/
        sessions, unblocks the new login, AND unblocks it from the
        verification gate too, all in one call.
