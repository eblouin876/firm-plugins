description: "Run the build of a whole feature end to end — from scoping (or picking up an already-scoped feature) through build and review to a single merge-ready PR — by orchestrating the firm's lifecycle skills as subagents, self-directing between the human gates. The human is in the loop at scope approval, at any checkpoints the approved plan declared (manual test gates, known decision points), at genuine escalations, and at final review and sign-off — never for per-step merges. Use this skill WHENEVER the user wants to drive a feature or project from start to finish in one sitting rather than one step at a time: \"start a coding session\", \"let's build this end to end\", \"take this from plan to merge\", \"pick up this epic and build it\", \"run the whole pipeline on this\", \"work through this issue and keep going\". It is the conductor: it scopes (or picks up scoped work), files/updates the GitHub issue and marks it in-progress, then advances step by step autonomously — each step built by a build subagent (frontend/backend/etc.) as commits on one feature branch under one draft PR, reviewed internally before the next — keeping a decision log as it goes; when the final whole-PR review is clean it flips the PR ready and notifies the user to review, sign off, and merge. It never merges — the human merges — and between the two gates it stops only for declared checkpoints or decisions that genuinely need the human."

# Coding session

A coding session is the conductor for the build of **one feature**. The individual skills — `planning`, `frontend`/`backend`, `testing`, `code-review` — each do one job well; a coding session strings them together into the full **scope → issue → build → review → sign-off → merge** loop and runs it, so a feature goes from idea (or an already-scoped issue) to a single merged PR without you hand-carrying each step.

It orchestrates by **spawning subagents**, one per stage of work, each briefed to invoke the right firm skill with a focused context. The conducting thread stays lean — it holds the plan, the issue and PR numbers, the step checklist, and the decision log — while the heavy lifting (reading the codebase, writing code, reviewing a diff) happens in subagents whose context is thrown away when they finish. That's the token-efficiency doctrine at the session level: the orchestrator remembers *what* and *where*, the subagents do the *how* (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/token-efficiency.md`).

There are exactly **two standing human gates**: the user approves the scope (and with it, the autonomy contract — where the session will and won't stop) before any code is written, and the user reviews, signs off on, and merges the finished PR. Between those gates the session self-directs: it builds the feature step by step on one branch, reviewing each step internally, and stops **only** at a checkpoint the approved plan declared or at a decision that genuinely needs the human. Steps never get their own PRs or their own merges. The session never merges — merge is the human's call (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/definition-of-done.md`).

## Relationship to the headless Action pipeline

The firm has two ways to run the same loop, and this skill is one of them:

- **Headless Action pipeline** — `@claude` on a GitHub issue triggers the implement Action, which opens a PR; the review Action runs on the PR and routes `@claude`/`@owner` by outcome. It self-drives on GitHub with no thread attached. This is the fleet default for work kicked off from an issue.
- **Coding session (this skill)** — the loop is driven from an interactive thread using **local subagents**, so you watch it happen, keep a human in the loop at the gates, and flow straight into the next feature when a PR merges. Use this when you're sitting down to build something and want to conduct it, not fire-and-forget.

They are compatible: both produce one PR that closes one issue, so a piece of work can start in a session and be finished by the Action, or vice versa. Pick the session when a person is driving; pick the Action when the trigger is a GitHub event. Don't run both on the same issue at once — you'll get duplicate build agents racing on one branch.

## Core rules

- **Two standing gates, and only declared stops between them.** Gate 1: the user approves the scope and the autonomy contract before any code. Gate 2: the user reviews and merges the finished PR. Between them, stop only at a checkpoint the approved plan declared, or to escalate a decision that genuinely needs the human. Never invent ceremony stops; never skip the two gates.
- **One feature, one branch, one PR.** The session's unit is a feature. Its internal steps land as commits on a single feature branch under one draft PR — a step never gets its own PR or its own human merge. For an epic, each stage is a feature: one session pass, one PR, merged before the next stage starts.
- **Size-guard the PR at gate 1.** If the feature can't land as one reviewable PR (roughly a thousand-plus changed lines, or several unrelated subsystems), the plan must say so at gate 1 and propose splitting it into separate features/sessions. Splitting is a scoping decision made once, up front — not incremental merges imposed mid-build.
- **Steps advance autonomously.** Build a step, review it internally, fix the blockers, tick its box on the issue, push, move on. The user is not summoned between steps.
- **Keep a decision log.** Every judgment call made without the user — a choice between viable approaches, an assumption resolved unilaterally, a deviation from the plan — is recorded in the PR description's `## Decision log` as it happens: "chose X over Y because Z." This is what makes gate 2 an informed review rather than a rubber stamp on a diff the user didn't watch being built.
- **Orchestrate, don't inline the work.** Spawn a subagent for each build step and each review and let it invoke the firm skill. Don't write feature code or run the review yourself in the conducting thread — that bloats the orchestrator's context and defeats the point. The conductor reads the codebase only enough to write good subagent briefs.
- **The repo is the memory.** State lives in GitHub — the feature issue and its ticked step checklist, the `in-progress` label, the draft PR with its commits and decision log — not in the thread. Push after every completed step. If the session is interrupted, another session can pick the feature up from the branch, the issue, and the PR alone.
- **Merge-ready is the ceiling, never merge.** The session converges on `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/definition-of-done.md`: behavior meets acceptance criteria, meaningful tests pass, CI green, security clean, the final review's blockers resolved. Then it flips the PR to ready, **notifies the user, and stops**. No agent self-merges.
- **Bound the loop, then escalate.** Governs *review/quality* non-convergence: if a build↔review round can't converge in a couple of passes, or a finding needs a design decision, stop and bring it to the user with the diagnosis — don't thrash or force a risky change. An escalation is signal, not failure; the contract is that every mid-flight stop is worth the user's attention. (Distinct from a worker going *silent* mid-step — that's a liveness stall, handled by the cadence rule below, not this one.)
- **Watch workers actively, don't wait passively.** A stalled or dropped subagent emits no completion signal, so a passive wait can leave it dead for the better part of an hour. Dispatch in the background and back every worker with a right-sized watchdog; catch stalls in minutes, never busy-poll. See `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/worker-cadence.md`.
- **Route each subagent to the right model.** Reasoning-heavy stages (planning, plan-review, code-review) run on a stronger model; mechanical build/implementation runs on a cheaper one. Pass the model explicitly on every spawn (see "Model routing" below) — an unset model inherits the orchestrator's, which is the most expensive default and the main source of avoidable spend.

## Model routing

The session runs many subagents, and each is spawned with the `Agent` tool's `model` parameter. **Always set it** — leave it unset and the subagent inherits the orchestrator's model (Opus), which is the costliest option and the reason an un-routed session burns far more than it needs to. Route by what the stage actually demands:

| Subagent / stage | Model | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Orchestrator** (this conducting thread) | `opus` | Holds the plan, loop state, decision log, and gate decisions — reasoning-critical, and usually the session's own model already. |
| **Planner** (`planning` / `product-planning`, step 1) | `opus` | Investigation and design quality set the ceiling for everything downstream; cheap here is expensive later. |
| **Plan-review** (step 2) | `opus` | Judges whether a plan is actually buildable and what it glossed over — a judgment stage. |
| **Build / implementation** (`frontend`, `backend`, `testing`, `data`, `debugging`, `devops`, `infrastructure`; step 4 and every fix round) | `sonnet` | Mechanical execution against a concrete plan — Sonnet builds to spec well and is where the bulk of tokens are spent, so this is the biggest saving. |
| **Code-review** (per-step review, step 5; final whole-PR review, step 7) | `opus` | Correctness/security judgment — catching one real bug outweighs the token savings (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/token-efficiency.md`). |

Rules of thumb:

- **Default reasoning/judgment stages to `opus`, execution stages to `sonnet`.** The split above is the default; follow it unless the user says otherwise.
- **The user can override per session.** If the user asks to run a stage cheaper (e.g. "review on Sonnet this time" for a low-risk change) or richer, honor it for that session — the defaults are a starting point, not a lock.
- **Match the model to the risk, not the file count.** A large but mechanical build is still `sonnet`; a small but subtle security-sensitive change may warrant keeping review (or even build) on `opus`. When a build step is unusually tricky, it's fine to raise that one spawn to `opus`.

## Workflow

### 1. Start the session — scope new, or pick up scoped

Two entry points:

- **Scope new work.** The user is starting something fresh. Run the `planning` skill (or `product-planning` for a whole product) to investigate and draft the plan — spawn the planner on **`opus`** (see "Model routing"). Planning owns the investigate → draft → iterate loop; let it. Do **not** let planning file the issue and tag `@claude` yet — in a session, filing and the build trigger are the session's job (step 3), because the session drives the build with local subagents rather than the Action. Carry the draft plan into step 2.
- **Pick up an existing epic or issue.** The user points at an epic or issue already on GitHub. Read it (and its ADR/epic parent if any). If it's an **epic**, identify the next unstarted stage — the first `- [ ]` line / open sub-issue in roadmap order — and make *that stage* the feature for this pass; run `planning` on it if its issue is still a stub. If it's a **single issue** with an actionable plan already, use it as-is. Confirm with the user which feature you're picking up before proceeding.

Either way you arrive at **one feature** with a step-by-step plan concrete enough to build from.

### 2. Verify the plan, set the autonomy contract, get approval (gate 1)

Before it becomes the build brief, the plan must be sound. Spin up a short **plan-review subagent** on **`opus`** (brief it with the plan + the relevant part of the codebase) to sanity-check it for completeness, feasibility, missing edge cases, and blast radius the plan glossed over — a cheap pass that catches "this plan can't actually be built as written" before a build agent discovers it the expensive way. Fold its findings back into the plan.

Then make sure the plan carries the **autonomy contract** — the two things that define where the human will and won't be involved:

- **Declared checkpoints.** The plan explicitly lists any point where the session must stop for the user mid-build: a manual test gate (something only a person can verify — "check the OAuth flow against the real provider before we build on it"), a known decision point ("pick A or B once we see the query timings"), or anything irreversible or externally visible (a migration on shared data, a deploy). **The default is zero.** If the plan declares none, the session runs from approval to final sign-off without stopping.
- **The size guard.** If the feature won't fit one reviewable PR, the plan must say so here and propose the split (see Core rules). Don't let an unreviewable diff be discovered at gate 2.

Present the verified plan — including its checkpoints (or "none") — to the user and **iterate to explicit approval**. This is gate 1: the user is approving *what* gets built **and** *where they'll be interrupted*. Do not file anything or start a build until they approve. If they request changes, revise and re-present.

### 3. Record the issue and mark it in-progress

On approval, file/update the work in GitHub in the right shape (this is `planning`'s step-5 behavior — reuse it, but the session performs it so it controls the trigger):

- **Single feature/fix** → **one issue**: title from the goal, body is the plan (including the declared checkpoints), step-by-step as a `- [ ]` task list. The steps live as checkboxes on this one issue — do **not** file an issue per step. If it belongs to an epic, register it as a native **sub-issue** and add the `Epic: #<n>` marker + this issue's number on the epic's checklist line, so the epic reconciles on merge (see `planning`/`product-planning`).
- **Whole product / large effort** → epic + milestones + per-stage sub-issues (that's `product-planning`); then this session builds the stages one feature at a time, each through its own full pass of this loop.
- **Picking up an existing issue** → update it in place rather than filing a duplicate.

**Mark the feature issue in-progress.** Apply an `in-progress` label (create the label if the repo doesn't have one — a distinct color, description "actively being built in a coding session"). Label the epic in-progress too while a session is advancing it. Remove the label when the feature's PR merges (step 8); the closing issue is the completion signal, the label just says "a session has this right now" and prevents two drivers colliding.

Do **not** tag `@claude` on the issue — in a session the *session* drives the build via local subagents (step 4), so tagging the Action too would start a second, racing build. (Tagging `@claude` is the handoff for the *headless* path, not this one.)

### 4. Build — steps land as commits on one feature branch

Work the plan's step list in order. For each step, pick the build skill from the nature of the work, then spawn a subagent to do it — on **`sonnet`** by default (build is execution against a concrete plan; see "Model routing"), raising that one spawn to `opus` only when the step is unusually subtle or security-sensitive. Dispatch it under the worker-cadence discipline — background dispatch plus a right-sized watchdog, not a blocking wait (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/worker-cadence.md`):

| Work is mostly… | Skill the subagent invokes |
| --- | --- |
| Client UI — components, pages, forms, styling | `frontend` |
| Server — endpoints, models, migrations, auth, jobs | `backend` |
| Both | brief the agent to use `frontend` **and** `backend`; if the step is large, prefer splitting it into a frontend sub-step and a backend sub-step and sequencing them |
| Tests are the deliverable | `testing` |
| Infra / CI / containers / deploy | `devops` (app pipeline) or `infrastructure` (hosting) |
| Data seeding or reporting | `data` |
| A diagnosed bug fix | `debugging` |

Brief the subagent with: the issue number, this step's slice of the plan and its acceptance criteria, the specific skill to invoke, the **feature branch** name, and the bar — `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/definition-of-done.md`. Instruct it to:

- Build **this step only**, as commits on the shared feature branch, meeting all benchmarks — meaningful tests at the right levels, lint/type-check/tests green **locally**, security clean, docs moved with the code. It does **not** open a per-step PR.
- **First step only:** open the feature's **draft PR** when green — `Closes #<issue>` in the body so the issue (and the epic box) reconciles on merge, a summary of the feature, an empty `## Decision log` section for the conductor to maintain, and — per this repo's `CLAUDE.md` — a `cc @eblouin876` line so the owner is notified. (In other firm repos, follow that repo's PR conventions.) **Draft status is the signal that the PR is not yet for the human**; it also gives the user a live window they *can* glance at, and CI runs on every push.
- Report back what it built, the commits it pushed, and anything it couldn't resolve.

Build agents run **sequentially** on the feature branch — never two at once. Keep the conductor thread out of the file-by-file work — the subagent holds that context. Between steps, if `main` has moved, bring the feature branch up to date (rebase or merge `main`) so the final PR never goes stale.

### 5. Review each step internally before advancing

After each step's build returns, spawn a review subagent on **`opus`**, briefed to invoke the `code-review` skill on **that step's diff** (the commits since the last reviewed point) and **report its findings back to the conductor** — not as PR comments. Mid-build commentary on a draft PR would bury the final review the human actually reads; per-step findings are working state, and the conductor holds them. Spawn this one under the same worker-cadence discipline as a build step (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/worker-cadence.md`).

- **Blocker/high findings** → spawn a build subagent (**`sonnet`**) to fix them on the feature branch, then re-review. Bound it: after ~2 rounds without convergence, or the moment a finding needs a human decision, escalate (step 6).
- **Clean** → tick the step's checkbox on the feature issue, append any judgment calls to the PR's decision log, push, and advance to the next step (back to step 4).

This is the drift-catcher: each step is verified before the next builds on it, so the final whole-PR review confirms an already-sound feature instead of discovering three steps of compounded problems.

### 6. Mid-flight stops — declared checkpoints and escalations only

Exactly two things interrupt the autonomous run:

- **A declared checkpoint** from the approved plan. When the step list reaches one, stop and present it: what the user needs to verify or decide, and exactly how (the branch to pull, the URL to hit, the command to run, the two options and their trade-offs). Wait for their answer, fold it in, resume.
- **An escalation.** A finding or a build problem needs a human call — a design trade-off, an ambiguous requirement, an architectural decision, a review loop that isn't converging. Stop and bring the specific blocker with your diagnosis and a recommendation. A back-and-forth that isn't converging is a signal to pull the human in, not to spin.

Nothing else stops the run. If the plan declared no checkpoints and nothing escalates, the user hears nothing between gate 1 and gate 2 — that silence is the feature working as designed, and it's what keeps every actual stop meaningful.

### 7. Final review — qualify the PR as ready

When every step is built, step-reviewed, and ticked, review the feature **as a whole**: spawn a review subagent on **`opus`**, briefed to invoke `code-review` in **pipeline mode** on the full PR diff. This pass judges the integrated feature — cross-step consistency, the complete behavior against the issue's acceptance criteria, security across the whole change — and **posts its findings on the PR**: per-finding comments with file:line, severity-ranked, plus a single summary comment with the verdict. This is the written review the human's sign-off leans on.

- **Changes needed** → spawn a build subagent (**`sonnet`**) to fix the blocker/high findings on the branch, then re-run the final review (**`opus`**). Bound it the same way: ~2 rounds, then escalate.
- **Clean** → verify the full definition of done holds (CI green on the PR, acceptance criteria met, checkboxes all ticked), finalize the decision log, and **flip the PR from draft to ready**. Ready-for-review status is the machine-readable "this is now for you" signal.

### 8. Sign-off and merge (gate 2)

Notify the user in the thread that the feature is ready. Give them a **sign-off package**, not just a link:

- The PR link and a one-paragraph summary of what the feature does.
- The **decision log** — every judgment call made without them, so they can push back on any of it.
- **Verification evidence**: CI green, final review clean, acceptance criteria checked off.
- **Anything only a human can verify** — from the declared checkpoints or surfaced during the build (e.g. "worth clicking through the new flow on staging before merging").
- For an epic: which stage this is and what's left.

Then **stop and wait**. This is gate 2; the session does not merge. If the user requests changes, treat them as a fix round: build subagent applies them, final review re-verifies, re-notify. Once the user merges, the PR's `Closes #<issue>` closes the feature issue, which (via the sub-issue link + `epic-checkoff`) ticks the epic's box. Remove the `in-progress` label.

### 9. Advance to the next feature, or close out

- **Epic with stages remaining** → return to step 1's "pick up scoped" path for the next `- [ ]` stage and run the full loop again — new feature branch, new PR, its own gate 1 and gate 2. Announce each advance so the user always knows which feature is active and how much remains.
- **Single feature, done** → close out: confirm the issue closed (and the epic box ticked, if any), remove any lingering `in-progress` labels, and give the user a short wrap — what shipped, the merged PR, and any follow-ups that surfaced but were left out of scope (file them as issues rather than dropping them).

## Subagent briefing notes

- **One skill focus per subagent.** A subagent is briefed to invoke a specific skill on a specific step or PR. Don't hand a subagent the whole session — hand it one stage of it. Its context dies when it returns; only what it reports (commits pushed, a verdict, a blocker) survives into the conductor.
- **Set the model on every spawn.** Pass `model` on each `Agent` call per the "Model routing" table — `opus` for planner/plan-review/code-review, `sonnet` for build/implementation. An unset model silently inherits the orchestrator's (Opus); that inheritance is the single biggest source of avoidable session cost.
- **Pass pointers, not payloads.** Give the subagent the issue number, the branch, and the step's slice of the plan, and let it read what it needs from GitHub and the repo. Don't paste whole files into the brief — that's the orchestrator paying for the subagent's reading.
- **Per-step reviews report to the conductor; only the final review posts on the PR.** The human's review at gate 2 should open onto one clean, current written review — not an archaeology dig through per-step bot commentary.
- **Build agents share the feature branch sequentially.** One at a time, always. If you ever fan out across *different* features, give each its own branch/worktree so they don't collide.

## What this skill does NOT do

- Merge, or advance past a ready PR without the user merging. Ever.
- Skip either standing gate — build without scope approval, or hand over without a clean final review.
- Stop mid-flight for anything except a declared checkpoint or a genuine escalation — no per-step check-ins, no PR-per-step, no asking the user to merge increments of a feature.
- Open more than one PR per feature, or run two build agents on the feature branch at once.
- Flip the PR from draft to ready before the final whole-PR review is clean.
- Tag `@claude` to trigger the headless Action while it's also driving the build locally (that races two build agents on one branch).
- Inline the build or the review into the conducting thread instead of spawning a subagent for each.
- Open a duplicate issue when picking up existing work — update in place.
