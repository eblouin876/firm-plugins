# eblouin-plugins

A Claude Code plugin marketplace: the development firm's lifecycle skills and a self-extending, version-aware reference library. This repo is itself a project in the firm — changes go through the same plan → PR → review → merge → release pipeline as any other repo.

> Names (`eblouin-plugins`, `dev-lifecycle`) are placeholders — rename to taste before first publish.

## Install

```
/plugin marketplace add <owner>/eblouin-plugins
/plugin install dev-lifecycle@eblouin-plugins
```

Enable background auto-update in `/plugin` → Marketplaces, or refresh manually with `/plugin marketplace update`. (Auto-pull of git-sourced marketplaces can lag; a periodic manual update is the reliable fallback.)

```

`.github/fleet-repos.txt` lists the repos the coverage audit scans for gaps — edit it as the fleet changes.

Skills reference shared files and library references by plugin-root path, e.g. `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/token-efficiency.md` and `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/frontend/react.md`. (Resolution is verified in the local plugin test; the fallback, if a path form doesn't resolve, is to copy the shared file into the skill's own folder.)

## Reference library conventions

References are **per-library**, not per-skill: one shared library the whole plugin loads from, so a doc is written once and every skill benefits. A build skill loads only the references for libraries actually detected in the project (progressive disclosure — see `shared/token-efficiency.md`).

Every reference carries a metadata header (see `references/_TEMPLATE.md`):

```
library · versions-covered · last-verified · provenance · sources
```

This header is load-bearing: it's what the freshness audit reads to decide staleness cheaply, and what distinguishes reviewed canon (`provenance: manual`) from machine-drafted docs (`provenance: auto-generated (pending review)`).

### Four ways a reference gets created or refreshed
1. **Onboarding (eager):** when a repo joins the firm, its significant direct dependencies are inventoried and any missing references are generated as a batch. Target frameworks/libraries with real idioms and version-sensitivity — not every transitive utility.
2. **Build-time (lazy):** if a build skill meets a library with no reference, it generates one for immediate use and opens a PR to add it here. This is model-driven and only fires when a build session has this repo in scope — the coverage audit (#4) is its reliable backstop.
3. **Scheduled audit (freshness):** `freshness-audit.yml` weekly flags references whose covered version or last-verified date has fallen behind; regeneration follows as a reviewed PR. Keeps the library **current**.
4. **Scheduled audit (coverage):** `coverage-audit.yml` weekly reads `.github/fleet-repos.txt`, inventories each fleet repo's significant dependencies, diffs them against the library, and opens a PR adding references for any framework in use but undocumented. Keeps the library **complete** — the automatic form of #2. Requires a `FLEET_READ_TOKEN` secret with read access to the (mostly private) fleet repos.

All four **ground generation in current official docs, never recall**, and all four land as **PRs you review and merge** — nothing enters canon silently.

### Templates and recipes (the starter kit)

Two further artifact types extend the library into runnable starter code, alongside plain references:

- **Templates** — composable golden-path **blocks** (`templates/<layer>/<name>/`, e.g. `backend/fastapi`) and lighter drop-in **catalog components** (`templates/components/<domain>/`), each declaring a composition contract (what it `needs` from the monorepo, what it `exposes`) so independently-authored blocks stitch together — see `templates/_TEMPLATE-README.md`. Authored via the `template-author` skill.
- **Feature recipes** (`references/recipes/<name>.md`) — portable how-tos that wire an already-authored block/component into one feature (Stripe checkout, S3 uploads, an auth provider) without inventing new infrastructure — see `references/recipes/_RECIPE-TEMPLATE.md`. Authored via the `recipe-author` skill.

Both carry the same kind of metadata header as a reference (`last-verified`, `provenance`, plus their own fields — `needs`/`exposes`/`versions-pinned-to` for a block, `applies-to` for a recipe) and pin to `references/compatibility-matrix.md`, the keystone pinned version set every block/component is built against. Both must clear **four acceptance bars** before they ship — composition-contract present, documented, version-pinned, secure-by-default (per `references/security/secure-baseline.md`) — enforced by their authoring skill, not left to review to catch. Documentation is co-located and portable: every block/component/recipe ships a doc fragment that aggregates into a scaffolded project's root README, per `references/authoring/documentation-standard.md`.

`docs/STARTER-KIT.md` is the index of the whole kit — every block, catalog component, recipe, and wiring ref, enumerated with what it materializes to and what it needs/exposes.

## Releases (semver)

Version lives in `plugin.json` and `marketplace.json`. `release.yml` bumps it on a merged PR based on a label — `release:major` / `release:minor` / `release:patch` (default patch) — then tags. Users only receive updates when the version bumps, so an in-progress push never destabilizes a working session. Roll back by pointing the catalog entry at a prior tag/commit.

Each release also force-moves a **moving Action-contract tag** (`v1`) onto the release commit. Projects' Action caller stubs pin to it (`...reusable.yml@v1`), so improvements to the implement/review workflows reach the whole fleet on release — same "only on version bump" model as the plugin — without editing any project's `.github/workflows/`. The tag tracks the reusable-workflow *interface* (its inputs), not the plugin's semver; if that interface ever changes incompatibly, bump `ACTION_MAJOR` in `release.yml` and re-point the stub templates to the new `@vN`.

## Owned vs guest repos

- **Owned:** full in-repo pipeline — committed Action, branch protection, committed `.claude/settings.json` + `CLAUDE.md`. Set up by the `scaffolding` skill.
- **Guest (repos you don't own):** zero footprint. The skill library rides in via this user-installed plugin — nothing added to the repo. Project-local config goes in untracked files excluded via `.git/info/exclude`. Work runs under your own identity, so commits and PRs are yours; attribution is blanked (`{"attribution":{"commit":"","pr":""}}` in `~/.claude/settings.json`) and the `onboarding` skill scrubs any residual Claude attribution before push. Set up by the `onboarding` skill.

## Validation

`scripts/validate_plugin.py` checks the JSON manifests and the YAML frontmatter of every `SKILL.md` — the things Claude Code rejects on install. It runs in CI (`validate.yml`) on every push and PR, so a malformed skill can't be merged or shipped. Run it locally before pushing:

```bash
python scripts/validate_plugin.py
```

Make the `validate` job a **required status check** in branch protection so nothing merges without it. The workflow also runs the official `claude plugin validate` as a best-effort cross-check.
