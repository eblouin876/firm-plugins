"""This block's Django settings module. Not a vendored file — new glue,
env-driven per this block's composition contract (see README.md "Composition
contract"). Every value that varies per-environment is read from process env
via `os.environ`, matching `secrets-loading/secret_store.py`'s "process env
first" posture (`core/contract/secret_store.py`, vendored below) rather than
Django's own `django-environ`/python-decouple conventions — this block has no
dependency on either.

`DEFAULT_RENDERER_CLASSES` is pinned to JSON-only (references/backend/
drf.md's "Browsable API": drop `BrowsableAPIRenderer` in prod). `REST_FRAMEWORK`
also wires the custom `EXCEPTION_HANDLER` (`core/exceptions.py`) that maps
DRF's own exceptions onto `core.contract.errors.ErrorEnvelope`, and the
`DEFAULT_PAGINATION_CLASS` (`core/pagination.py`) that emits `core.contract.
pagination.Page`'s `{items, total, page, size, pages}` shape — Stage 4 Step 2
(#27) — see this block's README, "Conformance", for the full wire-identity
target these two seams complete.

Stage 4 Step 3 (#27): this module now also wires the security-composition
MIDDLEWARE stack — see "Security composition" below for the full,
load-bearing MIDDLEWARE order and its rationale."""

# input_validation isn't wired as the DRF request boundary. `webhook_signature`
# and `idempotency` (also in the component catalog) are NOT vendored here at
# all -- payments-shaped concerns with no consumer yet; the Stage 11 payments
# recipe vendors and wires them when there's an actual webhook endpoint to
# protect (mirrors backend/fastapi's own "not vendored yet" posture for the
# same two components).
#
# **MIDDLEWARE order is OUTERMOST -> INNERMOST, TOP-TO-BOTTOM** for Django
# new-style middleware: `MIDDLEWARE[0]` wraps `MIDDLEWARE[1]` wraps ... wraps
# the view, so the request phase runs top-to-bottom (MIDDLEWARE[0] sees the
# request FIRST) and the response phase runs bottom-to-top (MIDDLEWARE[0]
# sees the response LAST, giving it the final word). This is the OPPOSITE
# mechanics of backend/fastapi's Starlette stack (that block's app.py docstring:
# `add_middleware()` prepends then the runtime stack is built by iterating in
# REVERSE, so the LAST `add_middleware()` call ends up outermost) — but the
# same top-of-list/last-call = OUTERMOST semantic falls out both ways, so the
# four components land in the SAME relative outermost-to-innermost order on
# both tracks, with one Django-specific exception (CORS) explained below.
#
# 1. **corsheaders.middleware.CorsMiddleware (OUTERMOST here — a genuine
#    divergence from backend/fastapi, where CORS is INNERMOST of the four).**
#    django-cors-headers' own docs require CorsMiddleware to run "as early as
#    possible" and specifically BEFORE `CommonMiddleware`
#    (core/security/cors_lockdown/django.py's module docstring): Django's
#    `CommonMiddleware` can issue a redirect (e.g. APPEND_SLASH) that returns
#    a response WITHOUT ever calling further into the wrapped middleware
#    chain — if CorsMiddleware were listed below (inside) CommonMiddleware,
#    that redirect response would never reach CorsMiddleware's own
#    response-phase header injection, silently breaking CORS on exactly the
#    requests that get redirected. Starlette has no equivalent "a middleware
#    can synchronously short-circuit before calling downstream" redirect
#    concern baked into CommonMiddleware's own contract, which is why
#    backend/fastapi's CORS sits innermost instead — a genuine Django-vs-
#    Starlette difference, not an inconsistency between the two tracks.
# 2. **security-headers.** Placed so it precedes (is outside) Django's own
#    `SecurityMiddleware` — see core/security/security_headers/django.py's
#    module docstring: Django's `SecurityMiddleware` already sets some of
#    this same header set (nosniff/HSTS/Referrer-Policy) under its own
#    SECURE_* settings; listing ours earlier in MIDDLEWARE means ours runs
#    LAST in the response phase and gets the final, authoritative word —
#    "component wins," backed up by this app's own Django SECURE_* settings
#    staying off (see "Transport security headers" below) so the two never
#    actually race in the first place.
# 3. **request-id / audit-bind (core/security/audit_logging/middleware.py,
#    NEW glue — not vendored, mirrors backend/fastapi's own audit-bind
#    middleware for this track).** Binds a per-request id (inbound
#    `X-Request-ID` if shape-valid, else a fresh `uuid4`) into audit.py's
#    contextvar BEFORE rate-limiting runs, so a rate-limit denial's own audit
#    trail (today: none — `rate_limiting.django.RateLimitMiddleware` doesn't
#    call `audit_event()` itself; a future stage that adds one gets the id
#    automatically) and every other downstream `audit_event()` call in this
#    request already carries it, without threading it through every call
#    site by hand.
# 4. **rate-limiting (INNERMOST of the four).** Pre-auth (this app has no
#    real authentication yet — Stage 5, #28 — so "pre-auth" and "for every
#    request" are the same thing today), general per-client-IP ceiling. Runs
#    inside request-id binding (so a 429 still carries the request id).
#
# Django's own `SecurityMiddleware`/`CommonMiddleware` are placed innermost
# of all six, below (inside) this stack — CORS still precedes CommonMiddleware
# per its own hard requirement (#1 above); security-headers still precedes
# SecurityMiddleware per its own hard requirement (#2 above); neither Django
# middleware has a documented ordering requirement relative to request-id/
# rate-limiting, so they sit closest to the view.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Secrets — Stage 4 Step 3 (#27). secret_store: ONE copy, not two. This
# block already vendored `secrets-loading/secret_store.py` verbatim in Step 1
# (`core/contract/secret_store.py`, alongside errors.py/pagination.py -- see
# "Vendored contract sources" in README.md) -- this step REUSES that copy
# rather than vendoring a second one under core/security/. Decision: leave
# it in `core/contract/` (not move it under core/security/secrets_loading/)
# because it is already established there as one of Step 1's three vendored
# contract sources, all sharing that directory's "keep in sync via the
# weekly freshness audit" maintenance path; moving it now would split that
# maintenance story across two locations for a file whose vendored content
# is unaffected either way. `core.security` (this step's new subpackage) has
# no `secrets_loading/` subpackage as a result -- see core/security/
# __init__.py's own docstring for the same note.
#
# `jwt_signing_key` is the concrete secret_store composition example, same
# seam backend/fastapi's app/core/config.py demonstrates: nothing in this
# block consumes it yet (Stage 5, #28, wires real authentication) --
# `required=False` and no invented default means this resolves to `None`
# until a project sets `JWT_SIGNING_KEY`, and this line itself never logs or
# raises with the resolved value (secret_store.get_secret's own "never log a
# secret value" posture -- see core/contract/secret_store.py's module
# docstring).

# names, same defaults, same rationale -- see that module's own docstrings
# for the full "why 900s / why 1_209_600s" reasoning this mirrors). Plain
# env-driven module-level settings, matching every other value in this file,
# rather than a pydantic Settings subclass -- this block has no such seam
# (see settings/README.md's "a project SUBCLASSES AppSettings" pattern,

# same rationale -- see that module's own docstrings for the full "why

#
# NOT yet wired into build_auth_service()/login itself -- that's the next
# Django-parity stage's (Agent B's) endpoint work; these fields exist so

# config to build against, the identical "inert until the next stage wires
# it" posture app/core/config.py's own Stage 5c fields document.

# --- Email (Stage 5c, #45): core/security/auth/stores.py's DjangoEmailSender
# delegates its actual transport entirely to Django's own pluggable
# django.core.mail EMAIL_BACKEND -- see that class's own docstring for why
# this Django track needs only ONE sender class where backend/fastapi needs
# two (ConsoleEmailSender/SmtpEmailSender). EMAIL_BACKEND/EMAIL_HOST/
# EMAIL_PORT/EMAIL_HOST_USER/EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD/EMAIL_USE_TLS are Django's
# OWN standard setting names -- django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend
# reads them automatically, so this app never hand-rolls an smtplib client
# the way SmtpEmailSender (backend/fastapi) does. EMAIL_HOST/EMAIL_HOST_USER/
# EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD route through secret_store (get_secret) -- the SAME
# "don't invent a secret" and AWS-Secrets-Manager-layered posture
# JWT_SIGNING_KEY documents (see that line's own comment, below) --
# EMAIL_PORT/EMAIL_USE_TLS/EMAIL_BACKEND/EMAIL_FROM are plain, non-secret
# config and stay ordinary os.environ.get() reads, matching JWT_ISSUER's own
# treatment above.
#
# DEPLOYMENT REQUIREMENT, mirroring app/core/config.py's own smtp_host
# comment: when AUTH_REQUIRE_EMAIL_VERIFICATION is True (the default), a
# real EMAIL_BACKEND (django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend) plus
# EMAIL_HOST/etc. MUST be configured in every production deployment, or
# get_email_sender() silently falls back to Django's own console backend --
# no delivery ever happens, and the console backend logs raw verify/reset
# tokens to this process's own stdout, a real secret leak if that ever runs
# in production. This is a REQUIRED DEPLOY STEP, not a code-level guard --
# unlike JWT_SIGNING_KEY (which fails closed at the point of use via
# AuthNotConfiguredError), EMAIL_BACKEND deliberately has no equivalent
# fail-closed check here, for the identical "a fragile runtime prod-
# detection check is easy to get wrong" reasoning app/core/config.py's own
# smtp_host comment gives.
