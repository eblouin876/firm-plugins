"""Regression test for the adversarial-review-flagged HIGH-severity Stage 5c
defect: `DjangoEmailSender` (`core/security/auth/stores.py`) used to
schedule delivery with `asyncio.create_task(...)` and return -- correct
under `backend/fastapi`'s uvicorn/ASGI deployment, but silently broken
under THIS block's shipped `gunicorn config.wsgi:application` deployment
(`backend/django/Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`). Every DRF view that
reaches `AccountService.request_email_verification`/`request_password_
reset` is an ordinary sync view bridged into the async `AccountService` via
`asgiref.sync.async_to_sync(...)` -- and `async_to_sync` creates a FRESH
event loop per call, drives the coroutine to completion, and TEARS THAT
LOOP DOWN before returning. Since neither caller awaits anything else after
`send()` returns, a task merely SCHEDULED (never run) on that now-dead loop
never actually delivered anything. Under this app's default
`AUTH_REQUIRE_EMAIL_VERIFICATION=True`, that meant EVERY verification email
(and every password-reset email) was silently dropped -- new accounts could
never verify, and the reset-based recovery path was equally dead. An
availability/auth denial-of-service; the anti-enumeration and generic-401
SECURITY properties were unaffected either way.

`tests/test_auth.py`'s own suite never caught this because its `email_
sender` fixture monkeypatches `core.security.auth.stores.get_email_sender`
with a synchronous, directly-`await`ed `_CapturingEmailSender` (see that
module's own docstring) -- deliberately so tests are deterministic, but as
a side effect the REAL `DjangoEmailSender`'s `send()` implementation, and
therefore the real `async_to_sync`-teardown hazard, is never exercised
anywhere in that suite.

This module closes that blind spot: it does NOT monkeypatch the sender --
it drives `POST /auth/register` through the real `APIClient` (real sync
DRF view -> real `async_to_sync` -> the real `DjangoEmailSender`), flushes
pending deliveries via `flush_pending_email_deliveries` (the deterministic,
non-`sleep`-based synchronization point that function exists for -- see its
own docstring), and asserts the verification email actually landed in
`django.core.mail.outbox` under `EMAIL_BACKEND=locmem`. Against the old
`asyncio.create_task` implementation this test fails (`outbox` stays
empty, and `flush_pending_email_deliveries` -- which also didn't exist
against that implementation -- would have had nothing to wait on with an
`asyncio.Task`-based design in the first place). Against the thread-pool
fix, delivery happens on a real OS thread that is not tied to the
`async_to_sync` loop's lifetime, so it genuinely completes.

`@pytest.mark.django_db(transaction=True)` for the same two reasons `tests/
test_auth.py`'s own module docstring documents (real autocommit semantics;
Django's async ORM under a rolled-back `atomic()` block is a known flake
source) -- this module drives the same `AuthService`/`AccountService`
machinery through the same real HTTP routes."""
