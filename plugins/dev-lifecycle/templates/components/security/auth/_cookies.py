"""Framework-neutral cookie/CSRF transport for the auth component --
the double-submit-cookie CSRF defense, cookie-name constants, and pure
cookie-kwarg builders a framework adapter (`fastapi.py`/`django.py`) maps
onto its own `Response.set_cookie`/`delete_cookie`. Stdlib only (`hmac`,
`secrets`) -- **no FastAPI, Django, or SQLAlchemy import anywhere in this
file**, matching `_core.py`'s own "framework-neutral core" posture; this
module is the transport-layer sibling of that file, not a replacement for
any of it. Canon: references/security/secure-baseline.md's CSRF guidance
(cross-site request forgery defense for cookie-authenticated requests).

Drop-in: copy this file into app/core/security/auth/_cookies.py, alongside
`_core.py` and whichever framework adapter(s) a project vendors -- see
this component's README's "Cookie/CSRF transport" section for the full
composition contract.

**Why this file exists, and why it is separate from `_core.py`.** `_core.py`'s
`AuthService`/`TokenService` mint and verify JWTs; they have no opinion on
HOW those tokens travel between client and server. A project choosing to
put the refresh token (and, by extension, the CSRF token below) in an
HttpOnly cookie rather than a response body needs a second, ORTHOGONAL
mechanism, because a cookie is sent AUTOMATICALLY by the browser on every
request to a matching origin+path -- including cross-site requests a
malicious page triggers without the victim's knowledge or consent (classic
CSRF). Bearer-token auth (an `Authorization` header a client must
deliberately attach) has no equivalent exposure, which is exactly why
`_core.py`+`fastapi.py`/`django.py`'s existing bearer-token path needs no
CSRF defense at all -- CSRF and the double-submit check below apply ONLY
to the cookie path this file adds, never to the bearer path.

**The double-submit-cookie pattern, in one paragraph.** On login/refresh,
the server sets TWO cookies: the (HttpOnly) refresh token, and a
(non-HttpOnly) CSRF token the SPA can read via `document.cookie` and echo
back as a request header on every state-changing request. A forged
cross-site request can make the browser ATTACH the CSRF cookie
automatically (cookies are sent regardless of origin), but the attacker's
page cannot READ that cookie's value (browsers enforce same-origin on
`document.cookie`) to also set the matching header -- so a forged request
always arrives with the cookie present but the header missing or wrong.
`verify_double_submit` below is the server-side check that enforces
exactly that: header and cookie must BOTH be present and BYTE-IDENTICAL.
This composes with, but does not replace, the `SameSite=Lax` cookie
attribute set by the builders below -- see their own docstrings for why
both layers matter (defense in depth: `SameSite=Lax` blocks most
cross-site sends outright, catching browsers or edge cases the double-
submit check alone might miss; double-submit catches everything else,
including any origin/environment where `SameSite` support or enforcement
is imperfect)."""

    1. `csrf_header` is present AND non-empty (a missing `X-CSRF-Token`
       header, or one sent as an empty string, both fail here);
    2. `csrf_cookie` is present (a missing `csrf_token` cookie fails
       here, regardless of what the header says); and
    3. `hmac.compare_digest(csrf_header, csrf_cookie)` is `True` -- the
       two values are byte-identical.

    **Constant-time comparison, deliberately never `==`.** Python's `==`
    on strings short-circuits on the first mismatched byte, so its
    running time leaks information about how many leading bytes of a
    guess were correct -- a timing side-channel an attacker could exploit
    to recover the CSRF token byte-by-byte across many requests.
    `hmac.compare_digest` is specifically designed to take the same time
    regardless of where (or whether) the inputs first differ, closing
    that channel. This is the SAME reasoning `_core.py`'s own security-
    critical comparisons follow throughout (e.g. why `PasswordService`
    never compares hashes with `==` either) -- applied here to the CSRF
    token instead of a password hash or a token digest.

    **All three failure modes collapse to the SAME generic
    `CsrfValidationError`, with no distinction in the exception raised**

    NOT separately signaled) -- mirroring `_core.py`'s own repeated
    "don't leak which specific reason" posture (`InvalidCredentials`,
    `InvalidToken`/`TokenReused`, `InvalidSingleUseToken`): telling an
    attacker probing this endpoint WHICH half of the double-submit check
    failed would only help them figure out what to try next.

    The `and` chain below short-circuits deliberately -- `csrf_header`
    and `csrf_cookie` are only passed to `hmac.compare_digest` once both
    are already known to be truthy `str` values, so a `None` (missing
    header or cookie) never reaches `compare_digest` (which requires two
    `str`, or two `bytes`, arguments -- a `None` would raise `TypeError`,
    not the intended `CsrfValidationError`)."""

    # attacker-controlled `X-CSRF-Token` header can carry non-ASCII bytes

    # raises `TypeError` on a non-ASCII `str` -- which would surface as a

def _cookie_kwargs(*, key: str, value: str, max_age: int, httponly: bool) -> dict:
    """Shared shape every builder below returns -- a framework-neutral
    dict a framework adapter maps onto its own `Response.set_cookie(...)`
    (FastAPI/Starlette and Django both accept a `set_cookie(key=, value=,
    max_age=, path=, httponly=, secure=, samesite=)` call with these exact
    keyword names, so no adapter-side renaming is needed). Every flag
    below is fixed for every cookie this component sets -- there is no
    caller-configurable escape hatch, deliberately: a project that needs
    different cookie semantics is not using the double-submit pattern
    this file implements.

    - **`path="/auth"`** -- the cookie is attached by the browser ONLY to
      requests under `/auth/*` (login, refresh, logout) -- never to
      item/health/admin/any-other route. Scoping the path this narrowly
      shrinks the set of endpoints that receive the refresh/CSRF cookies
      at all, which shrinks the attack surface for both cookie theft
      (fewer places a token could leak via a route-specific bug) and CSRF
      (fewer routes need the double-submit check in the first place).
    - **`secure=True`** -- the browser will never transmit this cookie
      over plain HTTP, only HTTPS. A refresh token (or a CSRF token that
      guards it) sent in plaintext over the network is as good as
      published; this flag is non-negotiable on every environment that
      terminates TLS, which is every environment this component targets
      (see `references/security/secure-baseline.md`).
    - **`samesite="lax"`** -- the browser withholds this cookie on
      cross-site sub-resource requests and cross-site `POST`/`PUT`/etc.
      (exactly the CSRF vector: a malicious page's forged `<form>` submit
      or `fetch()` to this app's origin), while still attaching it on a
      top-level cross-site navigation (a user clicking a link, or
      following an emailed link, INTO this app) so an ordinary
      "click a link and land logged in" flow keeps working. `Strict`
      would additionally withhold the cookie on that top-level-navigation
      case too -- breaking the common "click the link in your email"
      pattern this component's own `AccountService` verify/reset flows
      rely on. `None` would re-open exactly the cross-site-POST exposure
      `Lax` exists to close, making the cookie flow that in every browser
      request regardless of origin -- the entire reason `SameSite` exists
      at all. `Lax` composes with `verify_double_submit`'s own check as
      DEFENSE IN DEPTH, not a substitute for it: an older browser, a
      misconfigured proxy, or a `SameSite`-exempt request type (some
      browsers still allow certain top-level GETs through even under
      `Strict`-adjacent policies) could theoretically let a cookie
      through that `SameSite` was meant to block -- the double-submit
      check catches that request anyway, because the attacker's page
      still cannot read the CSRF cookie's value to also forge the header.

    cookies -- see `build_refresh_cookie_kwargs`/`build_csrf_cookie_kwargs`
