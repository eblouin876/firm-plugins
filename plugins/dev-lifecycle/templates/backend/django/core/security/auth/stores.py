"""App-specific Django-ORM-backed implementations of the vendored auth
component's `UserStore`/`RefreshTokenStore`/`SingleUseTokenStore`/
`LockoutStore` protocols (`_core.py`), plus the app-level
`PasswordService`/`TokenService`/`AuthService` construction Agent B's views
call via `build_auth_service()`.

Stage 5c (#45) additionally adds this app's `DjangoEmailSender`
(`get_email_sender` — ONE class covering both dev/test and prod, unlike
`backend/fastapi`'s two-class `ConsoleEmailSender`/`SmtpEmailSender` split;
see `DjangoEmailSender`'s own docstring for why) and `AuthEventSink`
(`AuditAuthEventSink`, forwarding to the vendored audit-logging component)
implementations, plus `build_lockout_policy`/`build_account_service`
factories for the new `AccountService` (email verification + password
reset). These are PLUMBING ONLY for this stage — `build_auth_service()`
below is UNCHANGED (still wires no `lockout`/`require_verification`/
`events` into `AuthService`); wiring `AuthService`'s own new keyword
parameters into `LoginView`/`RegisterView`, and calling
`build_account_service()` from the 3 new `/auth/verify-email`,
`/auth/request-password-reset`, `/auth/reset-password` views, is Agent B's
job (see this module's own factories' docstrings for the exact call shape
each expects).

**NOT a vendored file** — it lives alongside `_core.py`/`django.py`/
`__init__.py` in this directory because that is where this app's auth
wiring naturally sits, but it imports `core.models` and
`django.conf.settings`, so it is ordinary app code (see `__init__.py`'s own
docstring for the same distinction the component's README documents:
"these import `core.models`, so they are block app code, never part of the
vendored component"). The weekly freshness audit does not touch this file.

**Async ORM only, never bare sync ORM.** Every store method below uses
Django's async QuerySet API (`.afirst()`, `.acreate()`, `.filter(...).
aupdate(...)`, `.filter(...).adelete()`) — this block's locked "stores use
Django's ASYNC ORM" decision. A bare sync ORM call (`.first()`, `.create()`,
plain `.filter(...).update(...)`) executed from inside the async context
these methods run in would raise `SynchronousOnlyOperation` — Django's async
ORM support does not silently fall back to a thread-pool bridge the way,
say, `sync_to_async`-wrapped code does; it refuses outright. Agent B's views
bridge the other direction (an ordinary DRF sync view calling into this
async `AuthService`) via `asgiref.sync.async_to_sync`, not by making these
stores sync.

Reference implementation this file's shape mirrors: `backend/fastapi`'s
`app/core/security/auth/stores.py` (SQLAlchemy `AsyncSession`-backed) — see
each class/function below for exactly what carries over unchanged and what
differs because Django's async ORM has no session object to hold.

    `session.commit()` explicitly after each write because SQLAlchemy's
    `AsyncSession` holds a session-scoped transaction that only `flush()`es
    (makes a change visible to later queries WITHIN that same transaction)
    by default — a `flush()` alone would not be durable against a
    concurrent, separately-connected transaction until an explicit
    `commit()` follows. Django has no equivalent session-held transaction
    to manage here: this block's locked posture is `ATOMIC_REQUESTS` left
    unset (see `config/settings.py`) and NO `transaction.atomic()` block
    anywhere around these calls (this block's own locked decision) — under
    that posture, every one of Django's async ORM write calls
    (`.acreate()`, `.filter(...).aupdate(...)`) is its OWN single
    autocommitted SQL statement, durable the instant the call returns, with
    nothing further to flush or commit. That is EXACTLY the durability

    (committed) before returning... so a concurrent second presentation of
    the just-rotated token sees the updated `used_at` and is correctly
    flagged as reuse rather than racing past this implementation's own
    write" — it falls out of Django's default autocommit mode for free,
    PROVIDED nothing wraps these calls in `transaction.atomic()` (which
    would defer the commit to the end of that block) or sets
    `ATOMIC_REQUESTS = True` (which would defer it to end-of-request,
    reintroducing exactly the race this Protocol forbids). `tests/
    test_auth_stores.py` uses `@pytest.mark.django_db(transaction=True)`

    **Deliberate simplification vs. the FastAPI reference: no `_as_utc`
    naive-sqlite patch-up needed here.** `SqlAlchemyRefreshTokenStore`'s
    reference implementation must re-attach `timezone.utc` to every
    datetime it reads back on sqlite (its hermetic test dialect), because
    raw aiosqlite has no native timezone-aware datetime type and always
    hands SQLAlchemy back a NAIVE value regardless of what was written.
    Django's ORM sits at a different layer: with `USE_TZ = True`
    (`config/settings.py`, this block's locked setting), Django's own
    `DateTimeField` performs the naive<->aware conversion ITSELF, uniformly
    across every backend it supports — sqlite (this block's hermetic test
    dialect, via ISO-format string storage) and Postgres (prod, via a real
    `timestamptz` column) both hand back tz-aware UTC `datetime` values from
    the ORM, with no per-backend special-casing needed at the call site.
    `_refresh_to_record` (above) therefore reads `row.issued_at`/
    `expires_at`/`used_at` directly with no normalization step — this is a
    genuine simplification this Django-track module gets for free, not an
    oversight or a gap relative to the FastAPI reference."""

class DjangoEmailSender:
    """The single `_core.EmailSender` implementation this Django track
    needs, for both dev/test AND prod — built on Django's OWN pluggable
    `django.core.mail` backend system (`settings.EMAIL_BACKEND` —
    `config/settings.py`) rather than the two-class split (`_core.
    ConsoleEmailSender` vendored for dev/test vs. a hand-rolled
    `SmtpEmailSender` for prod) `app/core/security/auth/stores.py` needs on
    the FastAPI track. Django already ships a console-vs-SMTP-vs-anything
    `EmailBackend` abstraction (`django.core.mail.backends.{console,smtp,
    ...}.EmailBackend`) resolved from `settings.EMAIL_BACKEND` at SEND time
    by `django.core.mail.EmailMessage.send()` itself — this class never
    branches on which backend is configured, and never imports `smtplib`
    directly the way `SmtpEmailSender` does. `settings.EMAIL_BACKEND`
    defaults to Django's own `django.core.mail.backends.console.
    EmailBackend` (`config/settings.py`) — the SAME dev-only "print the raw
    token instead of delivering it" convenience `_core.ConsoleEmailSender`'s
    own docstring describes, just reached via Django's own backend
    machinery rather than a second Python class.

    **Delivered via a bounded thread pool, NOT `asyncio.create_task` --
    this is the fix for a HIGH-severity availability bug, read this
    carefully before touching it again.** An earlier version of this class
    scheduled delivery with `asyncio.create_task(self._deliver(message))`,
    the same pattern `SmtpEmailSender` (backend/fastapi) correctly uses.
    That pattern depends on the event loop that created the task still
    being alive, and still pumping, at some point AFTER the task is
    created -- true for `backend/fastapi`, which runs under uvicorn's own
    long-lived, continuously-pumped event loop. It is FALSE here: this
    app's shipped deployment (`backend/django/Dockerfile`, `docker-
    compose.yml`) runs `gunicorn config.wsgi:application` -- plain
    synchronous WSGI workers, never uvicorn/ASGI. Every DRF view that ends
    up calling `AccountService.request_email_verification`/
    `request_password_reset` (which call this class's `send()`) is an
    ordinary SYNC view that bridges into the async `AccountService` via
    `asgiref.sync.async_to_sync(...)` (see `build_account_service`'s own
    docstring). `async_to_sync` creates a FRESH event loop for that one
    call, drives the awaited coroutine to completion, and then TEARS THAT
    LOOP DOWN before returning control to the sync view -- and because
    neither `request_email_verification` nor `request_password_reset`
    awaits anything else after `send()` returns, a task merely SCHEDULED
    (not yet run) by `asyncio.create_task` inside that call never gets a
    chance to actually execute: the loop it was scheduled on is gone the
    instant `async_to_sync` returns. The result, under this app's default
    `AUTH_REQUIRE_EMAIL_VERIFICATION=True`: verification emails (and
    password-reset emails) were SILENTLY NEVER DELIVERED -- every new
    account was permanently unable to verify (and therefore unable to log
    in), and the reset-based recovery path was equally dead. An
    availability/auth denial-of-service, not a data-correctness bug -- the
    anti-enumeration and generic-401 SECURITY properties were unaffected
    either way, only delivery was silently dropped.

    A `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` (module-level `_email_
    executor` above) sidesteps this entirely: `send()` calls `_email_
    executor.submit(...)`, which starts running `_deliver_sync` on a REAL
    OS thread immediately -- that thread is not owned by, and does not
    depend on, whichever asyncio event loop happened to be running when
    `send()` was called (or whether one is running at all by the time the
    work finishes). It survives `async_to_sync`'s loop teardown by
    construction, and the identical `send()`/`_deliver_*` shape keeps
    working unchanged if this app later adds a real ASGI view path
    (`config/asgi.py` already exists for that -- see the `Dockerfile`'s own
    comment) since a thread pool works under both WSGI and ASGI, unlike
    `asyncio.create_task`, which only works when a loop is guaranteed to
    keep pumping.

    **Fire-and-forget by contract, still** — the SAME `_core.EmailSender`
    Protocol requirement as before (see `SmtpEmailSender`'s own docstring,
    backend/fastapi): `send()` SUBMITS delivery and returns immediately —
    it does NOT wait for the result, and it NEVER raises. This is what
    `_core.EmailSender`'s own Protocol docstring requires ("implementations
    MUST NOT let delivery latency or delivery failure affect the caller")
    and what `_core.AccountService.request_password_reset`'s
    anti-enumeration defense and `register`'s post-registration
    verification-email call both depend on. `_deliver_sync` (a plain SYNC
    method, running in the pool thread -- no event loop involved at all,
    so no `sync_to_async`/`anyio.to_thread` bridge is needed the way the
    old `asyncio`-task version needed one) performs the actual, potentially
    network-blocking `django.core.mail` send inside a `try/except Exception`
    that only LOGS (`_email_logger`, `warning` level) -- nothing above that
    method ever sees the exception, because nothing above it is waiting on
    this future's result at all (`send()` itself never calls `.result()`).

    **In-flight future lifetime**: `send()` registers every future it
    submits in the module-level `_pending_deliveries` set (added on
    submit, discarded by `_on_delivery_done`'s `done_callback` once the
    future finishes, success or already-caught-internally failure) --
    this is what `flush_pending_email_deliveries` (module-level, above)
    waits on, both for tests and as an optional graceful-shutdown hook.
    Unlike `asyncio.create_task`'s bare-reference footgun, a
    `ThreadPoolExecutor` future is not at risk of being garbage-collected
    mid-flight even without this set (the executor itself keeps the work
    alive) -- `_pending_deliveries` exists for `flush_pending_email_
    deliveries` to have something to wait on, not to prevent GC.

    **Best-effort on process shutdown, still an accepted caveat.** A
    delivery still running in a pool thread when the process is killed
    (not given a chance to shut down gracefully -- `SIGKILL`, an OOM-kill,
    a gunicorn worker recycled mid-request) is lost, same as any other
    in-process background send -- this is the SAME class of caveat every
    fire-and-forget in-process sender has (identical to the old
    `asyncio.create_task` version's own "best-effort on shutdown" note,
    and to `SmtpEmailSender`'s), just no longer compounded by the
    `async_to_sync`-teardown bug above. A project that needs a hard
    delivery guarantee (survives a crash, retried, durable) should replace
    this with a real queue/outbox -- `_core.EmailSender`'s Protocol is the
    seam that swap happens behind, unchanged for either `AccountService`
    caller; that is a Stage-11-and-later recipe, not something this stage
    adds."""

    vendored audit-logging component's `audit_event(...)`
    (`core/security/audit_logging/audit.py`) — this is the "thin adapter"
    `_core.AuthEventSink`'s own docstring describes a project wiring, kept
    as app code (not part of `_core.py`) so that module stays at "stdlib +
    PyJWT + argon2-cffi only, zero framework/app import". Identical shape
    and rationale to `app/core/security/auth/stores.py`'s own
    `AuditAuthEventSink` (backend/fastapi).

    `action`/`actor`/`outcome` pass straight through — `_core.py` already
    constructs `actor` as a bare opaque id string (a user id, `"anonymous"`,
    or `"unknown"`/`"user:unknown"` for a path with no trustworthy
    principal), so this sink never receives, and therefore can never leak,
    a raw token, password, or email address as a field. `audit_event`'s own
    redaction is a second, independent line of defense on top of that, not
    the only one. `resource` is a fixed `"auth"` string, not per-event —
    every event this sink ever receives IS an auth-subsystem event acting
    on the actor's own account.

    `audit_event` (unlike `_core.AuthEventSink.emit`) is a plain SYNCHRONOUS
    function — no network/DB I/O, just a structured `logging` call (see
    that function's own docstring) — so this method calls it directly,
    with no `await`, despite `emit` itself being declared `async def` to
    satisfy the `AuthEventSink` Protocol.

    **What `outcome="success"` means for `auth.email.verify_requested`/
    `auth.password.reset_requested`** (emitted by `_core.py`, forwarded
    here unchanged): it denotes that the request was accepted and delivery
    was DISPATCHED to `DjangoEmailSender` — never that the email was
    actually delivered. `DjangoEmailSender.send` is fire-and-forget by the
    `EmailSender` Protocol's own contract (see that class's docstring), so
    this sink is never in a position to know the real delivery outcome by
    the time it emits. A genuine delivery failure IS still attempted and

    `settings.AUTH_LOCKOUT_ENABLED` is `True`, `None` when it isn't — both
    `AuthService` and `AccountService` treat a `None` lockout as "not
    wired, skip lockout entirely" (see each class's own `lockout` parameter
    docstring in `_core.py`), so this single function is the one place that
    decision is made, callable identically for either service's wiring.
    Identical decision to `app/core/security/auth/stores.py`'s own
    `build_lockout_policy(settings, session)` (backend/fastapi) — no
    `settings`/`session` arguments here, matching `get_token_service()`'s
    own no-argument, `django.conf.settings`-reading posture above (Django's
    async ORM has no per-request session object for a caller to hand in
    either, unlike a SQLAlchemy `AsyncSession`).

    Agent B's `LoginView` wiring (the next stage's endpoint work) should
    call this SAME function when it builds its own `AuthService(lockout=...)`
    — sharing one `LockoutPolicy` instance (or at least one built against
    the same underlying `DjangoLockoutStore`/table) is what lets a
    successful `AccountService.reset_password` lift a lockout `AuthService.
    login` had recorded against the same account (see `_core.

    """Builds a fresh `AccountService`, the SAME composition shape
    `build_auth_service()` above uses for `AuthService` — a fresh
    `DjangoUserStore`/`DjangoRefreshTokenStore`/`DjangoSingleUseTokenStore`
    (each stateless, no `__init__`/session to hold — see this module's own
    docstring), the process-wide `get_password_service()`, `utc_now` as the
    single shared clock, `AuditAuthEventSink()` for `events`, `build_lockout_
    policy()` for `lockout` (built against the SAME underlying
    `DjangoLockoutStore` table `AuthService`'s own wiring should use — see
    that function's own docstring), and `settings.FRONTEND_BASE_URL`/
    `AUTH_VERIFY_TTL_SECONDS`/`AUTH_RESET_TTL_SECONDS` for the link-building
    and TTL configuration. No arguments beyond the keyword-only `email`
    below, matching `build_auth_service()`'s own no-argument,
    `django.conf.settings`-reading posture.

    `email` (Stage 5c #45 endpoint work, keyword-only): the `EmailSender` to
    use — `None` (the default) resolves it via `get_email_sender()`. A
    caller that already has one resolved from elsewhere (e.g. a test's own
    fake `EmailSender`) passes it directly instead. Identical seam to
    `app/core/security/auth/stores.py`'s own `build_account_service(...,
    email=...)` (backend/fastapi).

    This is what Agent B's `/auth/verify-email`, `/auth/
    request-password-reset`, `/auth/reset-password` views call — a DRF view
    bridges into the returned `AccountService`'s async methods via
    `asgiref.sync.async_to_sync(...)`, the same bridge `build_auth_service()`
    above already documents for `AuthService`. Raises `AuthNotConfiguredError`
    if a caller happens to also need `get_token_service()`/`build_auth_
    service()` in the same view and `settings.JWT_SIGNING_KEY` is unset --
    `build_account_service()` itself never touches `JWT_SIGNING_KEY` (it has
    no `TokenService` dependency at all), so it never raises that error on
    its own."""
