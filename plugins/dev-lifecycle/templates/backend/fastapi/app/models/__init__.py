"""Model aggregator: imports every ORM model in the app so a single
`import app.models` registers the full schema on `Base.metadata`.

Nothing outside this package should import an individual model module
(`app.models.item`) directly for its import *side effect* — always go
through `app.models` (this file) instead, so a future model that forgets
to update this file fails loudly (missing from Alembic autogenerate,
missing from `Base.metadata.create_all()` in tests) rather than silently
never being migrated or registered. Importing a model's *class* directly
(`from app.models.item import Item`, as app/api/routers/items.py does) is
unaffected — this aggregator is about the registration side effect, not
about where callers get the class from."""
