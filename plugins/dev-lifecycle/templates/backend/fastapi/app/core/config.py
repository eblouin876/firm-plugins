"""App-specific settings: this project's own `Settings`, subclassing the
vendored `AppSettings` (app/core/settings.py, vendored from
templates/components/backend/settings/settings.py — see that file's header
note). NOT itself a vendored file — this is the per-project composition
point settings/README.md documents ("a project SUBCLASSES AppSettings"),
so it lives here rather than inside the vendored settings.py, keeping that
file byte-identical to its source for the freshness audit.

`get_settings()` is `lru_cache`d so `Depends(get_settings)` (or a plain
call from app/main.py's lifespan) doesn't re-read/re-validate the
environment on every call — matching the "fails fast at startup" intent:
the first construction either succeeds once or raises once, and every
subsequent call reuses that same validated instance. Tests that need a
different environment call `get_settings.cache_clear()` after changing env
vars (see tests/conftest.py).

Stage 3 Step 3b (#26): adds the config the security-composition wiring in
app/main.py's create_app() needs (rate limiting, security headers) plus one
concrete secret_store composition example (`jwt_signing_key`) — see each
field's own docstring below for its default and why.

    # failure), a missing SMTP_HOST fails open and quiet -- the app keeps
    # running, /auth/register still returns 201, /auth/login still works
    # for already-verified accounts -- while get_email_sender() silently
    # falls back to ConsoleEmailSender, which:

    #       leak into this process's log aggregator if it ever runs that
    #       way in production, and

    #       can complete /auth/verify-email, so no one can ever satisfy
    #       login's require_verification gate (short of the password-reset
