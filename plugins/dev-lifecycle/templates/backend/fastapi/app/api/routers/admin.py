"""RBAC admin example (Stage 5d, #46) -- `GET /admin/ping`, gated by
`require_admin` (`app/api/deps.py`: `require_roles(get_current_principal,
"admin")`, from the vendored auth component's `fastapi.py`). Demonstrates
the role-gating machinery end to end, with no new auth logic of its own:

- **200** for an authenticated principal whose `AccessClaims.roles`
  includes `"admin"`.
- **403** `permission_denied` for an authenticated principal WITHOUT the
  `"admin"` role -- `require_roles`'s dependency raises `InsufficientRole`
  (`app/core/security/auth/fastapi.py`), mapped by `app/main.py`'s
  `_auth_error_handler` via the vendored component's `AUTH_ERROR_HTTP`
  table.
- **401** `unauthenticated` for a missing/malformed/expired bearer token --
  `get_current_principal` (which `require_admin` itself depends on) raises
  `InvalidToken` before this handler's body, or even `require_admin`'s own
  role check, ever runs.

Every one of those three outcomes is entirely the existing `get_current_
principal`/`require_roles`/`AuthError`-handler machinery already proven by
`GET /auth/me` and `tests/test_auth.py` -- this router adds no new
authentication or authorization code, only a route to exercise it as an
admin-only example.

Reuses `HealthStatus` (`app/schemas/health.py`, `{"status": str}`) as the
response shape rather than inventing a near-identical model -- this
endpoint's own success body is exactly `{"status": "ok"}`, the shape
`HealthStatus` already is (see that schema's own docstring).

--- Stage 13b: admin user management ---------------------------------

Every route below is gated the SAME way `admin_ping` is (`Depends(
require_admin)`, bound as a parameter here rather than in `dependencies=`
so the resolved `AccessClaims` is available in the handler body too --
`claims.sub` is the acting admin's own id, used both as the audit actor and
for the self-protection guard, below), PLUS a second, TIGHTER per-route
rate limit (`require_admin_rate_limit`, this module's own `InMemoryBucketStore`
-- see that dependency's own comment) layered on top of the general per-IP
`RateLimitMiddleware` (`app/main.py`) every request already goes through --
the admin surface is the highest-value target in this app, so it gets its
own, stricter ceiling.

Every mutation (`suspend`/`ban`/`reinstate`/`roles`/`force-verify`/`delete`)
is audited via the vendored audit-logging component's `audit_event(...)`
(`app/core/security/audit_logging/audit.py`, called directly here -- it's a
plain synchronous function, no `AuthEventSink`/`await` indirection needed
the way `app/core/security/auth/stores.py`'s `AuditAuthEventSink` wraps it
for the auth core) -- `actor=claims.sub`, `resource=f"user:{user.id}"`
(a `type:id` identifier, never the user's email), `outcome="success"`, and
`changed_fields=[...]` naming which column(s) changed -- NEVER the raw
before/after values themselves (a status/role-list change is not sensitive
the way a password/token is, but this still follows `audit_event`'s own
"identifiers, not payloads" posture).

**Self-protection.** The acting admin can never ban/suspend/delete their
OWN account, nor drop their OWN `"admin"` role via `PUT .../roles` --
`_ensure_not_self`/`set_admin_user_roles`'s own inline check raise
`ConflictError` (409 `conflict`) for exactly that, preventing an admin from
locking themselves out. `force-verify`/`reinstate` have no such guard --
neither is capable of a self-lockout (verifying or reinstating one's own
account is harmless), matching the endpoint contract table this stage's
plan specifies.

**State machine, not blind idempotency.** `suspend`/`ban`/`reinstate` each
validate the CURRENT `status` before transitioning -- see each handler's
own docstring for the exact from-state set -- raising `ConflictError` (409)
for a transition that doesn't apply from the user's current state (e.g.
`suspend` on an already-`banned` user, `reinstate` on an already-`active`
one). This is what gives `409` real, checkable meaning beyond
self-protection for these three routes, matching this stage's own endpoint
contract table (`suspend`/`ban`/`reinstate` all document a `409`).

**Admin queries are UNFILTERED by `status`.** Every handler below queries
`User` directly via `AsyncRepository` (soft-delete-scoped by that
repository's own default, same as every other model), never through
`SqlAlchemyUserStore` (`app/core/security/auth/stores.py`) -- that store's
`get_by_email`/`get_by_id` are now ALSO filtered to `status == "active"`
(Stage 13b's ban-enforcement fix, that store's own docstring) specifically
so the LOGIN/REFRESH/`/auth/me` path can't authenticate a suspended/banned
user; the admin surface must see and act on exactly those accounts, so it
never goes through that filtered seam."""
