"""`create_app()` factory: registers routers, registers the two exception
handlers the `error-envelope` contract requires (RequestValidationError ->
ErrorEnvelope 422; AppError hierarchy -> ErrorEnvelope with each
subclass's own status/code), configures OpenAPI metadata + the bearer
security scheme for the Stage 5 auth seam, and wires the Stage 3 Step 3b
(#26) security-composition middleware stack — see "Security composition"
below for the full, load-bearing order.

--- Security composition (Stage 3 #26, Step 3b) ------------------------
Four of the six vendored `app/core/security/` components are wired here as
middleware; the other two (secret_store, input_validation) are library
code composed at the point of use, not middleware (see app/core/config.py's
`jwt_signing_key` for secret_store's composition; app/schemas/item.py's
docstring for why input_validation's StrictModel isn't adopted there).
`webhook_signature` and `idempotency` (also in the component catalog) are
NOT vendored here at all -- they're payments-shaped concerns with no
consumer yet; the Stage 11 payments recipe vendors and wires them when
there's an actual webhook endpoint to protect.

**Middleware order is OUTERMOST -> INNERMOST, top-to-bottom in the prose
below -- but Starlette's `app.add_middleware()` PREPENDS to its internal
list and then builds the runtime stack by iterating that list in REVERSE
(confirmed against this project's pinned Starlette:
`Starlette.add_middleware` calls `self.user_middleware.insert(0, ...)`,
and `Starlette.build_middleware_stack` does
`for cls, args, kwargs in reversed(middleware): app = cls(app, ...)`).
The practical consequence: the LAST `add_middleware()`/`add_cors()`/
`add_security_headers()` call in `create_app()` below ends up OUTERMOST at
runtime. The calls in this factory are therefore ordered bottom-to-top
relative to the prose here -- read the code comments at each call site for
the "call N of 4" position.**

1. **security-headers (OUTERMOST of the `add_middleware()` stack).** Runs
   first on the way in and, more importantly, LAST on the way out -- it
   gets to set/overwrite headers on every response any of THIS app's own
   `add_middleware()` layers produce (rate-limiting's 429, CORS's preflight
   reply, a routed handler's normal response). Nothing downstream of it can
   suppress these headers by constructing its own response object, because
   this layer runs after all of them on the response path. One path sits
   OUTSIDE even this: a handler registered for the base `Exception` class
   (this app's catch-all 500) is pulled out by Starlette's own
   `build_middleware_stack()` and given to `ServerErrorMiddleware`, which
   that same method places outside every `add_middleware()` layer,
   including this one -- see `_make_unhandled_exception_handler`'s
   docstring below for the mechanics. That handler therefore stamps the
   same `SecurityHeadersPolicy` output (and the bound request id) onto the
   500 response itself, so "every response" stays true for that path too,
   just via a second, explicit call site rather than this middleware.
2. **request-id / audit binding.** Binds a per-request id (inbound
   `X-Request-ID` if shape-valid, else a fresh `uuid4` --
   audit_logging/middleware.py) into audit.py's contextvar BEFORE
   rate-limiting runs, so a rate-limit denial's own audit trail (today:
   none: `rate_limiting.fastapi.RateLimitMiddleware` doesn't call
   `audit_event()` itself -- a future stage that adds one gets the id
   automatically) and every other downstream `audit_event()` call in this
   request already carries it, without threading it through every call
   site by hand -- exactly the seam audit_logging/README.md's "Request-id
   binding (for Step 3 middleware)" section documents.
3. **rate-limiting.** Pre-auth (this app has no real authentication yet --
   Stage 5, #28 -- so "pre-auth" and "for every request" are the same
   thing today), general per-client-IP ceiling. Runs INSIDE request-id
   binding (so a 429 still carries the request id) and OUTSIDE CORS (so an
   attacker can't burn through the rate-limit budget with cross-origin
   preflight `OPTIONS` requests that never even reach CORS's own allow/deny
   decision -- rate limiting sees and counts every request regardless of
   origin).
4. **CORS (INNERMOST of the four).** Closest to routing/exception
   handling. Deny-by-default: wired only when `cors_allowed_origins` is
   non-empty -- see the call site's own comment for why an empty list means
   "skip CORS entirely" rather than constructing a policy that would fail.

    the status and code — see that table's own docstring in

    values rather than importing this app's `ErrorCode` enum directly (the
    vendored component has zero `app.*` imports; this handler is the one
    place that bridges the two).

    Registered for `AuthError` itself, not each concrete subclass — FastAPI/
    Starlette's exception-handler lookup walks an exception's MRO, so one
    registration here catches every subclass, present or future, without
    this file needing to know their names. A subclass with no entry in
    `AUTH_ERROR_HTTP` (shouldn't happen — every concrete subclass this app
    can raise has one) still fails SAFELY closed, at 401

    never a 500 that would leak "this specific auth exception type wasn't
    wired up" as an implementation detail.

    FIX (whole-PR review, Stage 5a): the 401 (`unauthenticated`) bucket
    emits a SINGLE fixed, generic client message, never `str(exc)` — see
    `_core.py`'s `TokenReused` docstring: "A client must not be able to
    distinguish 'reuse was detected and your whole session was killed'
    from 'this token was simply invalid' from the wire response alone."
    `_core.py` raises genuinely distinct messages within that same 401
    bucket (`TokenReused("...reuse detected -- the token family has been
    revoked.")` vs `InvalidToken("Refresh token has expired.")` vs
    `InvalidToken("Refresh token has been revoked.")`, etc.) — echoing
    `str(exc)` straight to the client, as this handler used to
    unconditionally do, would let an attacker replaying a stolen refresh
    token read "reuse detected" in the response body and confirm their
    token was burned, directly violating that contract. Every 401 auth
    failure (bad password, unknown/expired/revoked/malformed token, AND
    reuse) is therefore byte-identical on the wire. `conflict` (409,
    `EmailAlreadyExists`) and `permission_denied` (403, `InsufficientRole`)
    keep echoing `str(exc)` — neither carries a secret the way a
    refresh-token failure's exact cause does. `str(exc)` remains available
    server-side (it's still on `exc`) for logging/audit; this only changes

    FIX (Stage 3 review, MEDIUM): a handler registered for the base

    `Starlette.build_middleware_stack()` (see `key in (500, Exception)`) and

    guarantee (module docstring, point 1) does NOT hold for this one path

    `x-request-id`: `RequestIDMiddleware` sits inside `ServerErrorMiddleware`
    too, so its own `send_wrapper` never gets to set the header on this
    response either — but it DID already bind the id into

    this app never actually sends, silently reintroducing the exact

    point — https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/how-to/extending-openapi/) to
