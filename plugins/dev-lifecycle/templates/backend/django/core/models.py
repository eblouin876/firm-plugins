    (`config/settings_test.py`) runs the identical model against sqlite3,

    footgun this avoids.

       left at its default `ondelete` (RESTRICT).** Both refuse to delete a

       `PROTECT` raises `django.db.models.ProtectedError` INSIDE the ORM,
       before any `DELETE` statement reaches the database, while RESTRICT
       is enforced by Postgres itself at the SQL level (would surface as an
       `IntegrityError` instead). Neither this app nor `backend/fastapi`

       audit trail of past sessions" intent `0002_create_auth_tables.py`'s
       own module docstring gives for choosing RESTRICT over CASCADE.
    2. **No `created_at`/`updated_at` columns**, unlike Alembic 0002's
       `refresh_tokens` table (which carries them via
       `app/models/refresh_token.py`'s `TimestampMixin`). Omitted
       deliberately, not an oversight: this app's stores

       a queryset-level `.filter(...).aupdate(...)` call, and Django's
       `auto_now` only fires on `Model.save()` — a queryset `.update()`/
       `.aupdate()` bypasses model-level field machinery entirely, so an
       `updated_at` column here would silently go stale on every write
       instead of reflecting reality. Leaving the column out is more honest
       than shipping a timestamp that lies. `issued_at` already carries
