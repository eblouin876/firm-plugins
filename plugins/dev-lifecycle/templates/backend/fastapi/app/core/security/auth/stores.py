"""App-specific SQLAlchemy-backed implementations of the vendored auth
component's `UserStore`/`RefreshTokenStore`/`SingleUseTokenStore`/
`LockoutStore` protocols (`_core.py`), plus the app-level
`PasswordService`/`TokenService` construction this block's
`app/api/deps.py:get_auth_service` binds into a per-request `AuthService`.

Stage 5c (#45) additionally adds this app's `EmailSender` (`get_email_sender`
-- `ConsoleEmailSender` in dev/test, a hand-rolled `SmtpEmailSender` once
SMTP is configured) and `AuthEventSink` (`AuditAuthEventSink`, forwarding to
the vendored audit-logging component) implementations, plus
`build_lockout_policy`/`build_account_service` factories for the new
`AccountService` (email verification + password reset). `app/api/deps.py`'s
`get_auth_service` now also wires `lockout=build_lockout_policy(...)`,
`require_verification=settings.auth_require_email_verification`, and
`events=AuditAuthEventSink()` into the `AuthService` it builds, and a new
`get_account_service` dependency (same module) builds an `AccountService`
via `build_account_service` for the `/auth/verify-email`, `/auth/request-
password-reset`, `/auth/reset-password` routes (`app/api/routers/auth.py`).

**NOT a vendored file** — it lives alongside `_core.py`/`fastapi.py`/
`__init__.py` in this directory because that is where this app's auth
wiring naturally sits, but it imports `app.models` and `app.core.config`,
so it is ordinary app code (see `__init__.py`'s own docstring for the same
distinction the component's README documents: "these import `app.models`,
so they are block app code, never part of the vendored component"). The
weekly freshness audit does not touch this file.

    rolling-window logic lives in `_core.LockoutPolicy`, not here (see that
    class's own docstring).

    **`upsert`/`clear` each explicitly `commit()`** — lockout state MUST
    survive a process restart (a fresh connection/session, a new request
    hitting a different worker process) to actually do its job: an
    in-memory-only or flush-only lockout would silently reset on restart,
    letting a locked-out account's guessing resume immediately. This is
    THE property the real-PG16 integration script (see README's Alembic
    section) proves directly: write an `AttemptRecord` via this store, open
    a brand-new engine/session, read it back and see the lock still there.

    `upsert` reads then inserts-or-updates the ONE row per `account_key`
    (`login_attempts.account_key` is DB-level UNIQUE, per Alembic 0003) —
    matching `_core.LockoutPolicy`'s own documented, ACCEPTED non-atomic
    read-modify-write relaxation (see that class's docstring: a lockout
    race can only ever delay when a lock becomes visible by a small,
    bounded amount, never let a wrong password succeed). A genuine
    concurrent insert race for the SAME `account_key` (two simultaneous
    wrong-password requests, both seeing no existing row) is still caught
    at the DB level by that UNIQUE index — `upsert` falls back to updating
    whichever row won the race rather than letting the loser's request
    surface a raw `IntegrityError` as a 500."""

    **Why this exists, and why `POST /auth/register` never accepts a
    caller-supplied `roles` field.** `RegisterRequest`
    (`app/schemas/auth.py`) has no `roles` field, and `AuthService.register`
    always calls `UserStore.create(normalized, password_hash, roles=())`
    with an empty tuple (`app/core/security/auth/_core.py`) -- a client

    on registration, a straightforward privilege-escalation bug. This
    function is the ONE place `SqlAlchemyUserStore.create(..., roles=
    ["admin"])` is ever called with a non-empty role list from this app's
    own code -- an operator (or a test's own setup fixture) invokes it
    directly, server-side; it is never reachable from any HTTP request
    body.

    Mirrors `AuthService.register`'s own shape (normalize the email, hash
    the password via the process-wide `PasswordService`, `UserStore.
    create`) rather than delegating to `AuthService.register` itself and
    then separately promoting the row to admin after the fact -- there is
    no `UserStore` method to change roles post-creation (see `UserStore`'s
    own `Protocol` in `_core.py`: `create` is the only place `roles` is
    ever set), so building the row with the right roles from the start,
    exactly once, is the simpler and more obviously-correct construction.

    **Commits immediately** -- unlike `SqlAlchemyUserStore.create` itself
    (which only flushes, deferring to `get_db()`'s end-of-request commit
    boundary -- see that store's own class docstring), because this
    function has no enclosing HTTP request to ride a commit boundary on:
    it is called from a script or a test fixture's own setup, outside any

    `smtplib` + `email.message.EmailMessage` only (no third-party email
    library/pin), matching this app's "don't add a dependency for what the
    standard library already does" posture elsewhere in this catalog.

    **Fire-and-forget by contract** (adversarial-review fix, FIX 3): `send()`
    SCHEDULES delivery (`asyncio.create_task(self._deliver(message))`) and
    returns immediately — it does NOT await the SMTP round-trip, and it
    NEVER raises. This is what `_core.EmailSender`'s own Protocol docstring
    requires ("implementations MUST NOT let delivery latency or delivery
    failure affect the caller") and what `_core.AccountService.
    request_password_reset`'s anti-enumeration defense and `register`'s
    M2 resilience fix (`app/api/routers/auth.py`) both depend on: neither
    caller can tell, from `send()` returning, whether the message was
    actually delivered — only that delivery was scheduled. `_deliver` runs
    the actual blocking `smtplib` work on a worker thread (`anyio.to_thread.
    run_sync` — see that method's own docstring for why) inside a
    `try/except Exception` that logs a `warning` and swallows the error;
    nothing ever propagates back out of the background task, because
    nothing is awaiting it that could observe a raise or a return.

    **In-flight task lifetime.** A bare `asyncio.create_task(...)` result
    that nothing holds a reference to is eligible for garbage collection
    mid-flight (the task can be silently cancelled before it completes —
    see `asyncio.create_task`'s own docs on this exact footgun). `_tasks`
    (a `set`) holds a strong reference to every task this instance has
    scheduled for as long as it's in flight — added in `send()`, removed
    by a `add_done_callback` once the task finishes (success OR the
    already-caught-internally failure) — so a `send()` call's task is
    guaranteed to actually run to completion rather than vanishing.

    **Best-effort on shutdown.** This class holds no reference to the
    app's own lifespan/shutdown sequence, so a task still in flight when
    the process exits (a slow SMTP handshake racing a deploy) can be cut
    off mid-delivery — that email is then simply not delivered, silently,
    same as any other fire-and-forget background job. This is an accepted
    trade-off for a starter-kit reference sender: a project with a hard
    delivery guarantee should replace this with a real queue/outbox
    (persisted, retried, survives a restart) rather than an in-process
    `asyncio.Task`; `_core.EmailSender`'s Protocol is the seam that swap
    happens behind, unchanged for either `AccountService` caller.

    Always issues `STARTTLS` before authenticating — this app never sends
    a plaintext SMTP AUTH exchange (which would leak `smtp_username`/
    `smtp_password` to a network observer) over an unencrypted connection.
    `username`/`password` are optional (`None`/`None` skips the `AUTH`
