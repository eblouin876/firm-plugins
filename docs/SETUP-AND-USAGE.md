# Setup & Usage — the development firm

How to stand up this plugin and run your projects through it: delegate work to agents, review and merge yourself, from any device, whether or not the road has good signal.

This is the operator's manual. The plugin's internal conventions are in the repo `README.md`; this doc is about *using* it.

---

## What you've got

A Claude Code plugin marketplace (`firm-plugins`) containing one plugin (`dev-lifecycle`) with:

- **24 skills** spanning the whole project lifecycle — `technical-proposal` → `product-planning` → `scaffolding` / `onboarding` → `planning` → `ui-exploration` / `design-system` → `backend` / `frontend` / `mobile` → `data` → `copywriting` → `testing` → `code-review` → `devops` / `infrastructure` → `dependency-maintenance` / `security-audit` → `documentation` / `debugging` / `walkthrough` — plus `coding-session`, the conductor that runs the whole plan → build → review → merge loop for you, and `template-author` / `recipe-author`, the two meta-skills for extending the plugin's own starter kit (below).
- A **self-extending reference library** of per-library, version-aware docs (React, TypeScript, MUI, Tailwind, HTMX, FastAPI, Pydantic, SQLAlchemy, Postgres, Django, plus testing/devops/security/docs/debugging) — now growing a **starter-kit direction** alongside it: composable template blocks and feature recipes that `template-author`/`recipe-author` add, pinned to a shared compatibility matrix and a standardized security baseline (see the root `README.md`'s "Reference library conventions" for the full model).
- A **token-efficiency doctrine** every skill follows, a **worker-cadence doctrine** for how an orchestrator watches the subagents it dispatches (backstop cadence, not polling — used by `coding-session`), and a shared **definition-of-done** that is the merge-ready bar.
- Three automations: **semver release** on merge, a weekly **freshness audit** that flags stale references, and **epic checkoff** — a per-project workflow that ticks an epic's checkbox when a stage/feature issue closes on merge.

The spine is GitHub: issues are the task queue, PRs are work-in-review, CI is QA, **merge is yours**.

## One-time setup

### 1. Publish the marketplace
Push this repo to GitHub (private is fine):

```bash
cd firm-plugins
git init && git add . && git commit -m "firm plugin v0.1.0"
gh repo create <owner>/firm-plugins --private --source=. --push
```

### 2. Install the plugin
In Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add <owner>/firm-plugins
/plugin install dev-lifecycle@firm-plugins
```

Turn on auto-update in `/plugin` → Marketplaces (or add `extraKnownMarketplaces` with `autoUpdate: true` to settings). Because the plugin is **user-scoped**, all 21 skills now follow you into *every* repo you open — including ones you don't own — with no per-repo install.

> **Cloud sessions are different — see [Keeping cloud sessions current](#keeping-cloud-sessions-current).** The `/plugin` UI toggle and `~/.claude/settings.json` don't carry into Claude Code on the web, so cloud sessions can silently pin an old plugin version.

### 3. Your user settings (`~/.claude/settings.json`)
Applies everywhere you work, zero repo footprint:

```json
{
  "attribution": { "commit": "", "pr": "" },
  "env": { "DISABLE_NON_ESSENTIAL_MODEL_CALLS": "1" }
}
```

The blanked `attribution` is what keeps Claude out of commit/PR bylines on guest repos; `DISABLE_NON_ESSENTIAL_MODEL_CALLS` trims auxiliary model calls for cost.

### 4. Secrets for the automations
The firm authenticates with a Claude subscription token (OAuth), not an Anthropic API key.
- **Plugin repo:** add `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` as a repo secret so the freshness audit can run. Install the Claude GitHub App on it if you want the plugin repo to dogfood the pipeline too.
- **Each owned project repo:** the `scaffolding`/`onboarding` skills set `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` for you (`gh secret set`) when wiring the pipeline; you just install the Claude GitHub App once. No `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` anywhere.

---

## Bringing a repo into the firm

### A repo you own → `scaffolding`
> "Scaffold this repo" / "set up a new project for X"

It detects (or defaults to Python back / TypeScript front), lays down structure and tooling, writes a **lean `CLAUDE.md`** (the thing that keeps every later task cheap), and wires the pipeline: the Claude Action (from the firm's workflow templates — plugin loaded and OAuth auth), CI gates, branch protection requiring CI + a review, and a committed `.claude/settings.json` the cloud/Action agents inherit. Scaffolding now **composes a runnable monorepo** from the starter kit in the same pass — blocks, catalog components, and their doc fragments, not just bare structure — see `docs/STARTER-KIT.md` for the full catalog.

### A repo you don't own → `onboarding` (guest mode)
> "Onboard this client repo without touching it"

Zero footprint: local config goes in untracked files excluded via `.git/info/exclude`, work is authored as you under your own `gh` auth, commits/PRs carry no Claude attribution (blanked + scrubbed before push), branches are neutrally named, and there's no in-repo Action. You drive the builds yourself; the repo owner sees only your work, as you.

## Daily workflow

### A whole new product (greenfield)
1. **`technical-proposal`** — "What should we build this with, and what will it take?" Recommends the stack + architecture, justifies it, and gives an honest cost/timeline. The build/no-build decision.
2. **`scaffolding`** — creates and initializes the repo (`gh repo create`, structure, tooling, lean `CLAUDE.md`, pipeline wiring). This is what gives `product-planning` a place to file its epic.
3. **`product-planning`** — "Plan out the whole product." Produces the north star: vision, architecture/stack decisions, and a **staged roadmap** as a GitHub **epic + milestones + an ADR** in the repo. It stops there — no build.
4. **Per stage**, repeat: **`planning`** reads the epic + the stage stub, you go back and forth until you approve, then it files the stage issue as a **sub-issue of the epic** (with an `Epic: #<n>` marker and the issue number on the epic's checklist line) under its milestone and tags **`@claude`**. The build agent implements and opens a PR → the **review agent** reviews and **routes the outcome**: clear blocker/high fixes get handed to **`@claude`** to implement automatically (which re-triggers the review, converging when clean), while a clean review or any finding that needs your decision pings **you** — so you're only pulled in when there's a call to make → **CI** runs → **you merge**. On merge the stage issue closes, and the **epic-checkoff** workflow ticks its box in the epic (and GitHub's native sub-issue rollup advances the epic's progress bar) — so the roadmap stays current without you touching it. Then **`devops`** deploys (Goatenheim beta, or your chosen target) → next stage.

Because every stage plan references the epic and ADR, the whole product stays aligned to the north star.

> **Retrofitting an older epic.** Epics created before the epic-checkoff wiring have no `Epic:` markers or issue numbers on their lines, so their boxes won't auto-tick. Migrate one in place with the bundled one-shot — dry-run first, then `--apply`:
> ```bash
> plugins/dev-lifecycle/assets/scripts/retrofit-epic.sh <owner/repo> <epic#> [stage-issue#…]
> ```
> It adds the markers and numbers, links the sub-issues, and ticks any stage that's already merged. Idempotent, so re-running is safe.

### A feature or fix on an existing repo
1. **`planning`** — talk it through; on your approval it files the issue and tags `@claude` (owned repos) or hands it to you to run (guest repos).
2. Build agent → PR → review agent (auto-routes: clear fixes back to `@claude`, a clean pass or a needed decision to you) → CI → **you merge**.

> **Prefer to conduct it live?** `coding-session` runs that same loop from an interactive thread using local subagents instead of the headless Action — it scopes (or picks up an epic/issue), marks it in-progress, then builds the whole feature self-directed: steps land as commits on one branch under one draft PR, each reviewed internally before the next, with a decision log kept as it goes. You're in the loop at scope approval (where you also approve any mid-build checkpoints — manual test gates, known decision points; default none), at genuine escalations, and at the end, when a clean whole-PR review flips the PR ready and it pings you with the decision log to review, sign off, and merge. One feature, one PR, no incremental merges. Don't run it *and* `@claude` on the same issue — that races two build agents.

### The one rule that never changes
Agents plan, build, review, and get to green — **you approve the plan and you merge.** No agent ever merges.

### From any device / bad signal
Once a task is dispatched, it runs server-side (a cloud sandbox or the GitHub Action) — independent of your connection. Kick it off, close the laptop, lose Starlink; it keeps going. Check status, review the diff, and merge from the Claude mobile app's remote-control panel or GitHub mobile. Heavier or private work can run on **Goatenheim** over Tailscale and be reviewed the same way.

## The reference library

References are **per-library and version-aware**, loaded only when that library is detected — so a task pulls in exactly the docs it needs and nothing more.

**Three ways the library grows/stays fresh** (all land as PRs to the plugin repo that *you* review and merge — nothing enters canon silently, and everything is grounded in current official docs, never recall):
- **Onboarding** inventories a repo's significant dependencies and generates any missing references in a batch.
- **Build-time** fills a gap on the spot if a skill meets a library with no reference.
- **The weekly freshness audit** compares each reference's `versions-covered` / `last-verified` header against the library's current release and flags stale ones in a tracking issue. Its remit now extends past references to the whole starter kit — template blocks/components, feature recipes, the compatibility matrix, and doc-fragment drift (`just docs-check`) — so staleness anywhere in the kit is caught the same way. See `docs/STARTER-KIT.md` ("How it stays fresh") for the full breakdown.

## Maintaining the plugin

The plugin is itself a project in the firm — improve it through the same loop:
1. A change (new skill, edited reference, freshness fix) comes in as a **PR** to `firm-plugins`.
2. CI validates; **you review and merge**.
3. On merge, `release.yml` bumps the **semver** version (label the PR `release:major|minor|patch`, default patch) and tags it.
4. Your installs pick it up on auto-update, or run `/plugin marketplace update`.

Roll back by pointing the catalog at a prior tag.

## Keeping cloud sessions current

**The trap:** a release bumps the version fine, but Claude Code on the web keeps serving an **old** plugin — new skills never appear even in a "fresh" session started after the release.

**Why:** cloud environments run a setup script (`claude plugin marketplace add …` + `claude plugin install …`) **once**, then [snapshot the filesystem](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/claude-code-on-the-web#environment-caching) — including `~/.claude/plugins` — and reuse it for every later session, **skipping the setup script**. So the plugin is frozen at whatever version was installed the first time. Worse, `add`/`install` are **no-ops against existing state** ("already on disk" / "already installed"), so re-running them never upgrades. The snapshot only rebuilds when you **edit the setup script** (or ~7-day expiry). GitHub Actions are immune — each run gets a clean runner and clones the marketplace fresh.

There are two independent knobs; use the one that matches the scope:

### Environment-level (covers every repo sharing that cloud environment)
Fix the environment's **setup script** so it actually upgrades. `add`/`install` alone don't — add the `update` commands:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add eblouin-development/firm-plugins || true
claude plugin marketplace update firm-plugins        # pull marketplace → latest main
claude plugin install dev-lifecycle@firm-plugins || true
claude plugin update dev-lifecycle@firm-plugins       # upgrade the installed plugin
```

Editing the setup script **is** what un-sticks the current stale snapshot (it forces one rebuild). This is the low-effort fleet-wide fix: **you do not copy anything per-repo** — every project that runs in that default environment picks up the new version, with staleness bounded to the ~7-day cache window.

### Repo-level (tighter freshness for one repo)
Commit a `.claude/settings.json` (which *does* carry into cloud sessions, unlike user settings) that registers the marketplace for **auto-update** and, as a belt-and-suspenders guarantee, refreshes on session start:

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "firm-plugins": {
      "source": { "source": "github", "repo": "eblouin-development/firm-plugins" },
      "autoUpdate": true
    }
  },
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      { "matcher": "startup", "hooks": [ { "type": "command", "command": "{ command -v claude >/dev/null 2>&1 && claude plugin marketplace update firm-plugins && claude plugin update dev-lifecycle@firm-plugins; } >/dev/null 2>&1 || true", "timeout": 120 } ] },
      { "matcher": "resume",  "hooks": [ { "type": "command", "command": "{ command -v claude >/dev/null 2>&1 && claude plugin marketplace update firm-plugins && claude plugin update dev-lifecycle@firm-plugins; } >/dev/null 2>&1 || true", "timeout": 120 } ] }
    ]
  }
}
```

`autoUpdate` is the native path (refreshes and prompts `/reload-plugins` in-session where honored); the SessionStart hook is the CLI-level fallback (applies on the next session, since `plugin update` needs a restart to take effect). This repo ships exactly this block. Do **not** hand-copy it into every project — the natural place to standardize it is `scaffolding`/`onboarding`, so every firm repo gets it when it's brought into the pipeline.

**Bottom line:** for "all my projects," fix the **environment setup script** once — that's the fleet-wide lever. Reserve the repo-level `.claude/settings.json` block for repos where you can't tolerate the ~7-day window (like this one).

## What's not done yet

- **Testing pass:** each skill should get the skill-creator trigger-eval in Claude Code before you rely on it heavily, and the `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/...` reference paths should be confirmed to resolve once the plugin is installed (fallback: copy shared files into each skill's folder).
- The `release.yml` semver logic is a solid v1 to refine in practice. The `freshness-audit.yml` prompt's extension from references-only to the whole starter kit (templates, recipes, the matrix, doc drift — see `docs/STARTER-KIT.md`) lands this stage, closing out that part of the v1 gap.
