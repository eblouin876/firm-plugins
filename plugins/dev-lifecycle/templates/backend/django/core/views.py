"""DRF views — Stage 4 Step 2 (#27), the contract-emission layer, with the
`/auth/*` views given real behavior in Stage 5b (#44). Mirrors
`backend/fastapi`'s `app/api/routers/{items,health,auth}.py` handler-for-
handler; see each view's own docstring for the specific behavior it
reproduces and this block's README, "Conformance", for the wire-identity
target these routes work toward.

`items`/`health`/`readyz` wiring (Step 2 scope) stops at status codes +
JSON bodies; their `permission_classes` stay `AllowAny` deliberately (Stage
5, #28, only ever scoped to `/auth/*` -- see `README.md`'s own Stage 5
scope note), matching `backend/fastapi`'s items/health routers having no
`Depends(get_current_principal)` either, never a bare omission
(references/backend/drf.md's "Permissions & queryset scoping": "Never
leave an endpoint AllowAny by omission").

The five `/auth/*` views below ARE the real behavior: each validates its
request body via the matching serializer (DRF's own `is_valid(raise_
exception=True)` -- a malformed body still 422s, mapped by `core.
exceptions.exception_handler`'s `ValidationError` branch), builds a fresh
`AuthService` via `core.security.auth.stores.build_auth_service()`, and
bridges into that service's async methods with `asgiref.sync.
async_to_sync(...)` -- every one of these views is an ordinary SYNC DRF
`APIView` method (`def`, not `async def`), the same "sync view, async
service, bridged at the call site" posture `stores.py`'s own module
docstring documents. Every raised `_core.AuthError` (`InvalidCredentials`,
`InvalidToken`, `TokenReused`, `EmailAlreadyExists`) is left UNCAUGHT here
-- `core/exceptions.py`'s `exception_handler` maps the whole hierarchy onto
`ErrorEnvelope`, mirroring `app/main.py`'s `_auth_error_handler` on the
FastAPI track. No view below ever constructs an `ErrorEnvelope`/`AppError`
itself, same posture `app/api/routers/auth.py`'s own module docstring
documents for its FastAPI counterparts."""

    build_account_service()`'s own `lockout=build_lockout_policy()` call
    reads/writes (Django's async ORM has no per-request session object to
    share the way `backend/fastapi`'s `AsyncSession` does — see
    `build_lockout_policy`'s own docstring — so "the same policy" here
    means "the same underlying table", which is what actually matters:
    a lockout `LoginView` records is visible to, and can be lifted by, a
    later `AccountService.reset_password` call built from a completely
    separate `build_lockout_policy()` invocation).

    `RegisterView` deliberately does NOT use this — `AuthService.register`
    never consults `lockout`/`require_verification`/`events` at all (see
    `_core.AuthService.register`'s own docstring), so the plain, unwired

    `ItemOutSerializer`, return — same shape as the FastAPI router's own
    "validate, delegate, map, return" pattern.

    `queryset = Item.objects.all()` already excludes soft-deleted rows —

    answer instead of being silently accepted, matching the frozen

    Delegates to `AuthService.login` — raises `InvalidCredentials` (-> 401

    an account locked out from too many recent failures, AND (as of Stage
    5c) an account whose email isn't verified yet — all four are
    wire-BYTE-IDENTICAL, uncaught here (see that exception's own docstring
    on the deliberate user-enumeration defense, and `_core.AuthService.
    login`'s own docstring for the full 6-step state machine this now runs
    through `_build_login_auth_service()`'s wiring).

    Stage 5c: `auth_service` is now built via `_build_login_auth_service()`
    (this module, above) instead of the plain `build_auth_service()` every
    other `/auth/*` view still uses — the SAME `lockout`/
    `require_verification`/`events` wiring `backend/fastapi`'s
    `app/api/deps.py:get_auth_service` applies to its own `AuthService`.

    Stage 5d web cookie mode: `request.headers.get("X-Auth-Mode") ==
    "cookie"` switches this call into cookie mode — read directly off
    `request.headers` (present on a DRF `Request` the identical way it is
    on a plain `HttpRequest` — see `core/security/auth/django.py`'s own
    module docstring), deliberately NOT a declared serializer field: this
    keeps it out of `LoginRequestSerializer`'s documented shape, so this
    stage's wire-contract diff is exactly the new `/admin/ping` operation,
    not a field addition on an existing one — the byte-for-byte same
    reasoning `app/api/routers/auth.py`'s own `login` handler documents
    for reading it off `request.headers` rather than a declared FastAPI
    `Header(...)` parameter. Anything else (absent header, any other
    value) is BEARER mode — the exact, unchanged prior behavior; mode is
    NEVER inferred from any other signal, matching the locked design. No
    CSRF check on login either way: login is credential-authenticated
    (email+password), and there is no cookie yet for a CSRF check to
    protect.

    Cookie mode still returns the SAME `TokenResponseSerializer` shape —
    the wire contract is byte-unchanged — but with `refresh_token=""` in
    the body (an empty string still satisfies the schema's required `str`
    field); the real refresh JWT travels ONLY in the HttpOnly
    `refresh_token` cookie `set_auth_cookies` sets below, alongside a
    fresh, independent CSRF cookie (`generate_csrf_token()` — never
    derived from either token) a SPA echoes back as `X-CSRF-Token` on
    every cookie-authenticated `/auth/refresh`/`/auth/logout` call.
    `max_age` is `settings.JWT_REFRESH_TTL_SECONDS` — the SAME TTL
    `get_token_service()` mints the refresh JWT itself against (`core/
    security/auth/stores.py`), so neither cookie outlives the refresh
    token it's paired with. Byte-for-byte the same shape as `app/api/

    Stage 5d web cookie mode: DUAL-SOURCE, decided per-request by
    `read_refresh_cookie(request)` (whether the `refresh_token` cookie is
    actually present on THIS request), never by a header the client
    declares — a forged/absent cookie can't claim cookie mode, and a

      already rejects any other reused refresh token (401, whole family

    stay unchanged from the Stage 4 stub — this view enforces
    authentication itself, via `resolve_principal` below, rather than
    through DRF's own `IsAuthenticated`/`authentication_classes` machinery
    (which would reject a missing/malformed bearer with DRF's own 403/401
    shape, bypassing this block's `ErrorEnvelope` — see
    `core/security/auth/django.py`'s `resolve_principal` docstring: a
    missing or malformed `Authorization` header raises `_core.InvalidToken`
    directly, the identical exception a present-but-invalid token raises,
    so both land on the SAME 401 `unauthenticated` envelope via
    `core/exceptions.py`'s `AuthError` branch).

    `resolve_principal` (async, bridged via `async_to_sync`) already
    verified the bearer access token and resolved it to `AccessClaims`
    before this method's body does anything else — a missing/malformed/
    expired token never reaches the `DjangoUserStore` lookup below at all.

    `AccessClaims` carries `sub` (the user id) and `roles`, but not
    `email` — this handler does one direct `DjangoUserStore.get_by_id`
    lookup to fill in `PrincipalOut.email`, independent of `AuthService`
    (which has no "fetch a profile" method — see `_core.py`'s `UserStore`
    Protocol; it's a storage seam for `AuthService`'s own register/login/
    refresh flows, not a general user-lookup API this view reaches for) —
    identical to `app/api/routers/auth.py`'s own `me` handler.

    The user having been deleted BETWEEN minting the access token and this
    request (a real, if narrow, race — access tokens are not individually
    revocable) is treated as `InvalidToken` (401), matching
    `AuthService.refresh`'s identical "row valid but the user it points to
    is gone" handling — NOT a 404, since the token itself is what's no
    longer trustworthy, not a missing resource the caller asked for by
    id.

    Stage 4 Step 4 (#27): the `HTTPBearer` security scheme is registered
    (`config/settings.py`'s `SPECTACULAR_SETTINGS["APPEND_COMPONENTS"]`)
    and this view opts into it via `@extend_schema(auth=[{"HTTPBearer":

    get_auth()`, which is what actually populates the operation's

      the `"admin"` role — `has_role("admin")`'s permission class raises

    auth component, never through DRF's separate `authentication_classes`
    machinery.

    Reuses `HealthStatusSerializer` (`{"status": str}`) as the response
    shape rather than inventing a near-identical serializer — this

# admin's own id, needed here (unlike `AdminPingView`) as the audit actor
# and for the self-protection guard. `has_role`'s `BasePermission` has no
# way to hand its resolved claims back to the view body, so it would force
